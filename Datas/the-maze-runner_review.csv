1,"The Maze Runner(2014) is so cool, adventurous, and very exciting. The acting was well developed along with the characters, the plot was interesting, and the action rocks.",1
2,"I've been sooo disappointed by this movie. I read the book and it IS amazing: it goes deep in topics and feelings, it makes the reader think about important topics of life somehow. I actually guess that the movie will be nice for those who didn't read the book because it is an avarage movie with action and suspense.... but, man... this is nothing compared to the books. Dashner is a real genius for what he wrote and for the way he wrote it but the movie just ruined the mystery of the book. Through the pages, you learnt together with the Gladers to know the place around you and you came to understand it and eventually you figured out all the secrets of the Maze. This way, the movie lost the magic and transformed everything in a medium quality thing. The characters are wrong (almost all of them but Newt and partly Thomas), the values are wrong, the philosophy that rules the Glade and the Maze is wrong.. not to talk about the riddle to escape...  I will stop here... The movie really sucks if compared to the book.",0
3,"A stupid movie dressed up with a lot of sound and fury. It makes extensive use of a new device among bad movies/shows: pretending to be interesting by leading you on with mystery, and when it gets to the end you can tell the explanation was haphazardly slapped together after the mysterious elements and not before. It pretends to be smart, but is unaware of how stupid it is. I'm going to go ahead and call this ""Fake Science Fiction"".",0
5,"The Maze Runner is as good as the book (I've read it as well as seen this), and the best part about the movie is that it's totally different from the book, like how Gone Girl's ending will be different from the book's ending, as it is rumored to be.",1
6,"Sterile, Humorless and Chaste! OMG! Please Not A Sequel! I Beg You! The story makes no sense, whatsoever! Nada! Nothing! Not in the slightest! To make matters worse, the ending was nothing more then prepping the audience for a sequel! It was so in your face it was insulting. You mean the audience won't have a clue as to why all those innocent people died unless you come back and waste another 12 dollars! Wow! I will be avoiding any future sequel like the plague! The Maze Runner also reflects the sterile and chaste expectations of the American movie going audience. For starters, you have young men living together as a colony for up to as long as three years and they all have perfect haircuts! Give me a break! I couldn't believe how well groomed they all were. Did they have a hair stylist pop in from in from another dimension on a regular basis? And how could they all be so clean shaven? Did they bring razors and shaving cream with them? None of these men have delayed puberty problems that I could tell. LOL! Some of them must have developed facial hair after years of being stranded. But what bothered me most was what great shape their clothes were in. These are young men in there late teens and early 20's. Did they bring a seamstress and a washing machine with them, too!? They are supposed to be living like Robinson Crusoe, not like George Jetson! In this entire awful film there was only one single moment of humor. Even worse it has zero sexuality. Here's all these incredibly good looking and physically fit young men and we don't see a single one of them with their shirt off for a second! Why is non-stop violence, intense screaming and even murder is OK, but not showing off the male body? Why have we become such a warped and sterile society where death and violence doesn't offend in the slightest, but God forbid you show a single male nipple or hairy armpit?",0
10,"Another crappy movie released this year. Story is s***, acting is s***. Its supposed to be an sf mystery but it fails miserably. I can't believe they are going to release more of this c***.",0
12,"The Maze Runner is an intense and imaginative piece of work that I absolutely adored. However, this movie has a handful of flaws throughout, such as some character development, cliches and ""I predicted it"" sequences.",1
16,"I had a blast watching this. Directing was effective to convey the tension, that alone kept me invested. Characters development was a secondary task (but executed well), because the main spotlight of the film was the mystery of the maze and questions: why are we here and how we'll escape it?The creatures that inhabited the maze were nothing short of terrifying - stuff that felt taken out of ""Doom"" or something similar. The maze itself felt claustrophobic, which added a lot of tension.The only problems I had with this film were the explanations of major plot points and some weird plot twists. Besides that the film ultimately was a good time.",1
17,"Another YA adaptation gets the green light for a sequel this year, after Shailene Woodley’s star-making vehicle DIVERGENT (2014, 6/10), although both are welterweights compared to THE HUNGER GAMES juggernaut as far as rate of return is concerned.  THE MAZE RUNNER is unique in its claustrophobic single-location setting (considerably slims down the budget, an estimated $34 million set side by side with $85 million of DIVERGENT), 90% of time the youngsters (boys exclusively) are entrapped in a glade (so they are called gladers) with the only exit is a giant maze with jumbo cybernetic arthropods named Grievers preying them.continue reading my review on my blog: google cinema omnivore, thanks",1
18,"Amazing movie! Very nice, thrilling from the begining till the end. Wow, when I see this movie, my heart beat faster and faster..  I guess the director was good in directing the stories. The character, the conflict, the tension.. Everything goes so smoothly. Although i wonder how the hell that Gally manage to get out of the glade and survived and sad ending when Chuck died. I can't wait to see the second movie, coz it's worth to watch.",1
19,"Why oh why does Hollywood keep producing crap is simply beyond my understanding. I was about to leave the theater, but I stayed just so I can fully say this was total garbage. For the love of the silver screen fire whoever wrote the script and never employ them again. The plot is predictable, the story is lame, the ending, well...let me just say...there is no ending...everything hangs in the air...franchise and what not- If I go to the theater I want to watch a movie and not a series....STOP IT WITH YOUR FRANCHISE TRILOGY **** The best trilogies started as a full contained movies....just stop ....please!!!!",0
20,"This is a good film. The story is good, the characters are interesting, the maze is a cool setting and is emotional sometimes. This film is a good time.",1
21,A solid movie at most points throughout. The acting by the main character wasn't as I had hoped but there were many great performances by supporting characters. A few cool action scenes to keep you into the movie but it does get slow at times. A mediocre ending was a bit disappointing but it is an average overall movie.,1
23,"The Maze Runner may not be on the level of Katniss Everdeen and her fight, but just like The Hunger Games it gave its young cast room to shine with its creative story. The world inside and out of the maze isn’t just interesting, it’s impressive enough to make you want more. Yeah there could have been a few fixed holes, but the world created is fresh and entertaining. And if the filmmaker(s) can build off what they started here, this can become one of the few more then above average ‘young adult’ book to movie franchises we will see. Rating: 7.5/10",1
24,"This was pretty good, actually. The darker approach made it much more interesting than most YA movies and more intense, too. I also liked the turns the movie took. The protagonists were very likable and memorable. The sound, score, and cinematography were probably the best parts though. I'm definitely looking forward to the sequels.",1
25,"I read the book, so I was expecting a letdown. Thankfully, I was mistaken. Even though I didn't like the first half, as it tries to stay close to the original material and FAILS, the second half keeps a safe distance from it but doesn't take that many liberties as well, staying in a good middle ground where every book-to-film adaptation should stand. Surprisingly, the ending was better executed in the movie than in the book itself; the kind of ending that truly would've shocked me if I hadn't already knew what was coming. Really worth your time, this one.",1
26,"I've read the complete trilogy, and enjoyed every single page. I feel that the ratings are a bit low but they always seem to be for movies based off of novels. The movie focused very well on the maze and the violence,  but not so much on character development. Still, it had me on the edge of my seat. Terrific and terrifying, would recommend 9/10.",1
27,"*SPOILERS!* We start this **** show rat race out with boring characters and an over the top story line. At the end of this maze we discover an interesting twist... that twist of course being that the movie will never get better, you wasted your time, and you will never get it back. The End.",0
28,"I will never not enjoy watching attractive teens trying not to get slaughtered. That being said, there is a mystery at work in The Maze Runner that pushes the film beyond some of its YA adaptation brethren. I really wanted to know what's at the root of it all and wasn't at all disappointed with what I found. While I'm generally an advocate of waiting for the DVD, I think you need to see this one in the cinema to grasp the full scope of the filmmaker's vision.",1
29,"I wasn' expecting much until the ending, and altough the cinema was very empty this did turn out to surprise me slightly in the ending when you expect everybody to be either dead and the survivors barely figure out their situation. This is going to be an episodic like Twilight but with a different kind of story/premise.",1
30,"Cube(1997 Film) - A group of people wake up in a maze not knowing who they are and how they got there only to try an escape avoiding certain death. Sound similar, well it is. A complete ripoff of the 1997 Vincenzo Natali directed film Cube. Almost every major theme ripped off and copied except delivered much weaker with less tension and less thrills. Only difference is the stupid farming aspect and the open environment. If you want to watch a far superior movie with intense action, suspense, and clever twists go watch Cube.",0
31,"The Maze Runner has delivered a great visual spectacle, with an interesting plot and tense movie moments that makes us stay at the edge of our setas holding our breaths, and most parto of it was loyal to the book.",1
33,"The Maze Runner has captured the audience by amazement and originality by exploring uncharted topics and a mysterious world. The movie holds your attention to the credits and leaves the cinema beginning for more, more, more! Although the ending is some what a let down, so is some of the dialogue and acting by particular characters. Although this never really takes away from the overall experience, The Maze Runner is one of the best in 2014! sign me up for the sequel.",1
34,"At least there's a dystopian drama that DOESN'T focus on a female lead (""Hunger Games"", ""Divergent""). Unfortunately for ""The Maze Runner"", those books and counterpart movies were much more solid.",0
35,"""The Maze Runner"" was a fantastic film, and though it differed somewhat to the novel, I was very impressed. Perhaps the best part was the Grievers (the mechanical/organic crab-like monsters that infest the Maze). They had been done in such a frightening way and really made you feel as if you were in the Maze alongside Thomas.Everything else had been done well - every intense sequence in the book had been done well in the movie, etc. There was one minor problem, however: acting - but only really with the characters of Teresa and Minho. Teresa was portrayed quite plainly, and should have been allowed to keep her native English accent for the movie. She was consistently slipping in and out of accents, some parts of her dialogue in American accent and some in English.Minho wasn't developed well enough for the audience to care about, in my opinion. His expressions were wooden and he lacked variation in his acting.The best character (in both acting and development) was Chuck, whose death would easily affect sensitive people. The relationship between he and Thomas was surprisingly well done, too.A fantastic adaptation that was miles better than the book.",1
36,"Alrighty then. For someone who had not read the book, I guess this movie might be acceptable. However, for someone who has (me), this is a disgrace to the famed name of The Maze Runner. (I was looking forward to the part when Thomas beats Gally to a pulp. Then he gets speared).",0
37,"A total disappointment, being a fan of the novel I was let down entirely. Bad acting, the story was not followed well, it practically made no sense, I do NOT recommend.",0
39,"this movie was so disappointing and boring, hardly made any sense i only made it 45 minutes through it and was a waste of my time. don't  waste your time like me watch another movie",0
40,"I did not read the book, so I didn't know what to expect except that it was a sci-fi story set in some type of post-apocalyptic world.  Even though the movie was exciting, the lack of an explanatory ending ruined the entire movie...very little was explained...it was if if this was Part One!  However, nowhere in the title did it say ""Part One""  I really felt cheated and unfulfilled.",0
42,"O filme foi capaz de prender atenção e vai desvendando parte do mistério a cada conversa entre os personagens. Às vezes, explica até demais. De qualquer forma, tem um enredo interessante e garante boas horas de diversão.",1
45,"A mix between Lord of the Flies and The Cube, the most disappointing thing about the Maze Runner is the background, which we don't learn about until the end. It is supposed to be exciting and to compel us to watch the next two movies, but all it does is take credibility away from the entire story, which is already not very well-structured, being filled with pointless plot conveniences and generally all too linear frame setting. The movie is also somewhat long, yet it seems like time has been wasted here and there to focus on secondary action scenes, where the characters act on impulse and instinct, while it could have been focusing on the actual emotions the character MUST have been feeling when they're trapped in a giant dangerous maze that doesn't seem to have a way out. It is an action film, so it gets away with having bad acting throughout and average CGI. Its biggest faults are, as I said, the choices and timing of storytelling, and, of course, the fact that it has been presented as a mindless action film when it could have easily been more introspective and less blatant.",0
47,"Good acting, decent story, great action and amazing visual effects. I HIGHLY recommend it! Looking forward for the second part..  7/10 for this one :)",1
48,"Missed it at the cinema, so saw it on DVD today. I generally liked this movie, I like mazes. it kept me intrigued right till the end but i'm a little less wiser as to what these kids are? clones? DNA modified humans? its all a big test? hope there is a movie number two.",1
49,"It’s the mysterious maze, the acting performances and of course the instinct for survival that makes The Maze Runner epic and one of the best movies of 2014. The movie starts with a unique, mysterious and interesting opening scene and we are just as confused as the main actor. There’s not even a single moment where I would define myself as bored while watching The Maze Runner, the whole movie is highly mysterious and you really want to know why things are as they are. Therefor is this movie unique on it’s own way. It’s on the same time scary and highly entertaining, and combined with the soundtrack does it make The Maze Runner truly epic. The action sequences are great, and the characters lives are often in grave danger and that made me on several occasions really nervous. I was therefor totally in the movie, and you really want to know more and you feel like you are in the film. The Maze Runner is about survival, curiosity and hope. The story is extremely exciting and the characters are all stunning. The main character “Thomas” is wonderful, smart and of course curious. He’s so awesome. There’s also clear chemistry between many of the characters, and I really felt close to them all. The Maze Runner is a very well made film when it comes to CGI, details and depth. The film is greater than what my expectations were, and it repeatedly kept surprise me. The ending is exactly as every movie should be like: mysterious, exciting and spectacular. It makes the audience interested for a continuation. Still, the ending could have been even greater if they hadn’t revealed several aspects of the film. But it’s still a great ending, and yes I know many people might hate it, but I disagree. This is an almost flawless film that truly is of the best of the year. The Maze Runner gets an 8.2/10.",1
51,"I can't express how I really feel about this movie, but is a good feeling though. Mainstream, these are my thoughts: Pros: - Unpredictable turns of the story ( as soon as I didn't read the book )- Great acting- Cozy shooting place- Great use of actors- Where is good is evil too Cons: - Terrible score (background music)- So so clichee.",1
53,"I liked it almost better than the first hunger games. The ending was a bit confusing but there is going to be a sequel. So no need to complain, good movie in my opinion.",1
54,"I have read the book first before watching the movie. There were a lot of changes in this movie. For some reason, I don’t feel any remorse about these changes. In fact, I am okay with these changes. It’s understandable that these changes were made to make the movie more action-packed. In the book, the plot moves itself and the character development are just fun, interesting parts to read. The plot is just as good as the book and it’s really fast-paced during the entire movie. The cast performances were great at the most part. I really enjoyed the performances of Dylan O’ Brien, Thomas Sangster and Will Poulter. They acted as if they were born to play Thomas, Newt and Gally! I am not so sure about Kaya Scodelario's performance about Teresa. She did not convince me enough that she is Teresa, not an actress playing Teresa. I think she is a good actress so I hope she improves her acting in the sequel. The visuals of this movie are so breath-taking. It’s better than I imagined. It’s amazing and realistic and I said “Woah!” out loud in the cinema. The design of the Grievers were much more scarier than I imagined so it gives props to the visuals as well. The direction from Wes Ball is really excellent. He cared about making this movie even in the smallest of details. Lastly, the action scenes made me close to the edge of my seat. It was really well-choreographed which attributes to the cast’s performances. For people who have read the books, you’re not going to be disappointed despite its changes. And with excellent cast performances from Dylan O’ Brien, Thomas Sangster and Will Poulter, amazing visuals and direction, this movie makes the entire Maze Runner trilogy a promising, better replacement for The Hunger Games.",1
55,"The maze runner is a well made well acted movie with a alright ending and alright story. my ratting Action 7.9/10 story 7.7/10 acting 8/10 Characters/Character development 7.9/10overall 7.9/10",1
56,"Never read the book and thanks to the movie, I'm not going to. The pacing made me wonder if Michael Bay had anything to do with this film. It just so recklessly quick and it keeps going and going without explaining anything. There is hardly any meaningful development in any of the characters, anything we see in any of them within the first 5 minutes of the movie is how they behave for the rest of the their screen time. No progression. It also really bothered me how the many questions were raised in dialogue were never addressed...ever. It was just hole after hole in the story that just could not be saved by the complication of the maze or the crazy monster/alien things that were graphed on to robotic technology...just how far in the future are they if they can do that? And if they can do that then it kind of trivializes the whole idea of using the maze for child experimentation anyway doesn't it? I'm sorry, I wanted to like this, the previews made me curious, but I've been had. Most of the time in the theater was spent wondering what in the world is going on, and not the good kind of wondering. All in all i was waiting for the movie to finish long before it did and the ending didn't seem to clarify much of anything, just raise more questions...I mean...what is the point of the female in this? She does nothing. Not even touching the fact that they threw her in a forest with of bunch of teenage guys who haven't seen a  girl in years and there's not even so much as a catcall at her...really? You think they'd be so proper? And how do they stay so well shaven and got such nice fade haircuts when they live how they do? not even stubble? Minor problem I'll admit but it didn't help the world they were trying to create the feeling ya know and the tone was all wrong the casting was weak in some spots, there was emotion just in all the wrong places, I just get upset thinking about how awful this movie is, when it had high potential...this is long..last thing, you launch a franchise because your first film was solid, you don't launch a film because you think your franchise is solid. There are so many problems in the first one that I don't even care what happens next. Terrible waste.",0
57,"Wes Ball‬'s first big direction venture couldn't be ignored. Albeit ‪Dashner‬ hands him over his brilliant tale on a silver platter, Wes still makes it appear equally great. Dashner's story is a reflection of our real world. It makes you ponder, if we too are a part of something inexplicable, that our life is a maze and we are just surviving. Are we also pawns of someone's experiment? Are we supposed to search for a door? Our lives have inevitable elements like ‪‎Gally‬, like a religious preacher who stops people from going out or finding a door, forcing you to stay in the labyrinth, following rules that conventions made! And like ‪Alby‬ who was the oldest who created them for mere extant! ‪‎Will Poulter‬ was brilliant as Gally and ‪Dylan‬ worked really hard to get into Thomas' shoes! His acting is developing. The movie packs in surprises as it climaxes which were subtly portrayed. The screenplay hasn't much to offer, visual effects are fine. There are some flaws that can be ignored for the amazing concept. Pointing some - The deadly ‪Grievers‬ becoming suddenly less fatal when sticks were poked at them, the clichéd bit of Chuck's fate, the knock that brought Thomas' name back, a gal ‪Teresa‬ who has to be there even though she didn't have a purpose, questions like why couldn't they make a ladder Maze-tall in three frigging years? At least they could have seen where they were at, or if the walls were concrete and they had weapons couldn't they create fractures in the wall and try to climb? Overlooking every such minute bits it was overall a great movie on its way to become an even greater franchise!",1
58,I read the books so I already knew what was going to happen and was thinking going in that it probably wouldn't be a good adaptation of the book. I was completely wrong. This movie is great and the next one will be so much better. The first book is kinda slow but the second one is just phenomenal. Go see this movie you won't regret it I promise! :),1
59,"I can sum up this movie with one word. Disappointing.I can't see how anyone who has read the series would say otherwise.As with any book made into a movie, I understand the film can't be 100% like the book. Yet, trust me when I say that giving this movie a 2 is me being generous.The only relation that The Maze Runner movie has to the book is:1. The title2. The characters3. The locationAnd even then, the differences are noteworthy. While all the main characters from the book are there in The Glade, hardly anything holds true to the book. The attitude of the Gladers is more along the lines of being carefree and open than that of the tough, cautious and mysterious nature that is found in the book. It felt like a bunch of boys at an unsupervised summer camp that happened to be located in the middle of a maze, instead of a bunch of boys being thrown into the middle of a twisted experiment inside a deadly puzzle-labyrinth. The storyline and spirit from the book is really only evident in the most basic, miniscule amounts.For those who haven't read the books, the movie should have no problem entertaining and may even leave them excited for the sequel. However, everyone who waited for the movie to see the story in the book come to life on-screen is in for a rude awakening. This movie had the potential to really tell the great story of The Maze Runner, but sadly, that's not what happened.",0
61,"Great story and effects with the monsters,but the rest wasnt that good at all...It was like a show to me,short movie with a lot of questions to answer.",0
62,"Love the mistery and unknown ""halo"" around all the story, i was expecting a ""teenager film"" with love story and all that folllow; never been so wrong. Strongly suggested for entertainment.",1
63,"I came in this movie with low expectation and that's what I get. I didn't understand my friends were so amazed from it. I would have liked that the labyrinth is more on the focus than problems with the people in the center. I wish more action, how the labyrinth plays with the humans sanity. But they threat my sanity with the human interaction. I'm not any kind of emotionally touched. The acting isn't good. There's also not much interesting in the plot. The ending is predictable.The visuals were great - lots of unused potential.",0
66,The Maze Runner is like the best movie I have ever seen! It's plot was great with really good actors and special effects! I havent had the chance to read the books but im sure its will become a box-office hit!!!!!,1
67,"Great visuals, great story, great acting, nice special effects make for a very intense, entertaining flick that i would recommend to any viewer, especially those interested in survival of the fittest type flicks. The story is extremely interesting and mysterious, having not read the book i was in the beginning of the flick extremely curious as to what was inside the maze, throughout the entire movie was guessing as to why this maze exists and why these people are in it, which i found out some of the reasons and what was going on, only to be left at a ""to be continued"" ending, like most first entries in novel to film adaptations. That point aside, the entire movie was extremely tense, i was always fearing a character would die at any moment, i was extremely scared during the moments the characters encountered the main enemy in the movie. The movie may not be as good as the novel, not going as deep into themes and topics. But i can easily forgive any film that is an adaptation from a novel for this, they are taking a novel, something that takes readers hours with many breaks in-between to finish, and cramming it into a two hour flick that anyone can come and watch all at once. Of course the movie won't be as deep the main reason for that simply being it is a movie, not a book.",1
68,this is the best movie EVER. So much action! I watched it last night not expecting it to be this good. I loved it so much I could watch it every single day,1
69,"The Maze runner is a movie with semi-interesting setting that ends up being absolute garbage. Story goes something like this (spoiler free) :You watch teenagers in the forest for an hour, 40 minutes of some mostly boring labyrinth and last 5 minutes watching how astonishingly s***ty ending is there just to tell you to watch the sequel that comes god knows when. Also that one ""surprise"" at the end will purely shock you by how horribly it was done. Like please did you even try at this point?",0
70,"Despite having characters that lacked depth, some pretty big clichés, and an utter mess of an ending, The Maze Runner manages to be a well acted, dark, and a pretty enjoyable film altogether.",1
71,"The Maze Runner is incredible,and the history is fantastic,but with the time,the movie is boring,and the story lose his rtyme.Resuming:Assist this movie,but the history isn't surpreendent.",1
73,I would give this 8.5.  I did not know the story from the books nor did I watch the trailers.  I truly enjoyed the story and the characters.  I hope there is a sequel because I will be there on opening weekend.,1
74,Extremely lame movie most of the time. It begins with a lot of tension which gets lost immediately because of the way the movie focuses on the relationship of the members of the maze prison. This is done by using an extremely high amount of teeny clichés and bad voice acting it almost made me quit the damn thing. The only interesting part of the movie is when they first enter the maze. All that comes after is simply bad story leading to them finding out who's behind the maze and seriously that's so full of illogic crap i wont even write about it. 2/10 because most of the gang died in the end. I enjoyed that.,0
75,"Darker than your average YA book turned movie. It starts off kind of slow and it takes a bit to get into Thomas  (Dylan O'Brien) as the lead, but once things get going it's an entertaining movie that keeps you interested in the mystery. Even if this movie seems solely created for setting up big stuff in a sequel. It's got a talented cast playing these strong, likable group characters. There's also some nice action and a cool dystopian world that I wanted to learn more about. The problem is that it doesn't really answer any questions at all. What little explanations it does offer make no sense and just leave you with even more questions. Especially when you find out everything you have been told might be a lie. This sort of vague progression seems only in place to set things up for a sequel. Whether or not it's like that in the book I cannot tell you as I have not read it. However even if it did this type of formula doesn't work too well for this movie. It doesn't ruin it, but certainly hurts the overall experience. Still it's an enjoyable watch. One that is sure to please fans of movies like the Hunger Games series and Divergent. Even better is that it isn't preaching the same message of non-conformity that many other similar movies are. It's more wrapped up in it's own thing. Overall a solid first outing that has left me wanting more, even if mostly for the wrong reasons. I'll be coming back for the answers to questions, some of which this movie should have offered. I still think it's a solid flick though.",1
76,"As somebody who's read the book, I give nothing but praise for this great film adaptation. There were some changes (obviously), but overall, it stayed true to the plot of the book. All the actors did their jobs perfectly, and the film was well-paced. I don't like how people hate the ending, though. The book ended that way, so I expected it to end that way. I'm looking forward to the next film! :)",1
79,"This is a movie that is so disgustingly bad, it even beats how bad the novel it is based on is. There is absolutely nothing in the whole movie that carries any weight. The actors are mediocre, the characters they play are hare-brained and everything around them makes no sense at all. None of the characters act even remotely like a human being. They keep secrets for secrets' sake, conceal important information from each other for the hack of it and eventually the whole story is artificially revealed to be complete and utter nonsense with the sole purpose of luring more naive viewers into watching the next movie. To make all that even worse, even the movie itself lies to the audience. Things are stated that clearly aren't true. The maze is said to be changing, yet for the most part it is not and people are mapping it. Rules just established a moment before are broken as if they meant nothing, which is among the biggest problems of the film, because they really don't. Nothing in the movie matters, starting with the fact that the characters are barely characters at all. All in all it is a complete waste of time.",0
80,"Yes, this movie is targeted at teens. it is cheesy at times and not realistic. But even with all these negatives I still enjoyed watching this movie. The movie made me curious and I was interested in what will happen next. Looking forward to seeing the sequel!",1
82,"The Maze Runner series really appealed to me and long before it was a movie, I read all four books. I was hoping that like The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner would be a page for page telling of the story, but it wasn't and in fact several important elements crucial to the sequels were left out. The story begins with a boy named Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) waking up in an elevator, surrounded by dozens of other boys. Thomas has no memory other than his name and quickly learns that none of the other boys do either. They are all trapped in the middle of a maze with no idea why or how to escape. This film was done well, but compared to the book, it is like a seventh graders book report. All the players are the same and the events are relatively the same, but all those little things that made this series so special and unique were left out. The film is just a simple story with some terrific special effects, but the book was really extraordinary and non-readers will never have any idea of just how good this movie could have been. Teen Wolf's Dylan O'Brien stars and really was the perfect choice to play Thomas. Unlike some of the other casting choices, O'Brien really seems to jump right from the pages to the screen in a defining role that almost seemed made for him. Thomas was the same in the movie as he was in the book, but he was the only one. It's very hard to be objective about this, because if I hadn't read the book, I still would have enjoyed the film, but realizing just how much of the story is missing really bothers me and skewed my review of the film. The story is unique, the special effects are great, and their some very good young actors here, I still highly recommend The Maze Runner, but if you are a reader and you enjoy Science Fiction, by all means read the book first.",1
86,"This film, for me, would be deemed a sleeper sci fi hit. I expected this to be similar to the Hunger Games when it came to a post apocalyptic future with children in a ""game"" of sort. Some of the acting was wooden, but I expected that to be the case. Either way, the ending definitely peaked my interest. Some of the things throughout the movie were also pretty mysterious, which goes a long way in engaging the viewer. After the movie, I went and picked up the book series. Didn't really want to wait six or so years to see how the movie trilogy ends, if there is even a sequel.",1
89,"Rather good premise borrowed by the source material but **** applicationToken blacks, an asian is the best guy, a stronk independent womin comes out of a box to give the guy a romantic interest, guy gets cucked by a black dude, it's as if a jew produced it. Oh wait she did",0
90,"This is a really intriguing movie.  Its bizarre world is very fascinating and impressively fleshed out.  The maze is a triumph of art direction and seamless visual effects.  The characters, though not without some clichés, are for the most part solidly written.  The action is thrilling, the story is engaging, and the aesthetic is realistically gritty.  Although the big reveal could have been handled more effectively, and the secret itself could have been more creative, I'm still very interested to see where this franchise goes next.  It's one of the better YA adaptations without a doubt.",1
91,"not sure why this movie is rated so low. I personally loved it! one of my favorite movies to come out last year! Great acting, story, huge twists that you dont see coming, and pretty suspensful. This movie should definately be around a 8.5ish.  Im just giving it a 10 because of the extremely low score it doesnt deserve.",1
93,"I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this film. Although we saw similar plots before, I have to say that there was something new in this one. It was not all repetitive from the previous films of the same kind, it had something new in it. Those big spiders we saw before in some other films, I can not recall which ones but some similar animals were shown all the time in other sci fi films. The maze was spectacular and scenes inside were great. I really enjoyed it. Acting was good for the teen actors, I especially got fond of the character of the chubby little boy. All in all I have to recommend this film, especially to the crowds who enjoy sci fi films. Go for it!",1
94,"While this movie isn't graced with either amazing acting or a phenomenal script, it manages to create something that I actually forgot movies could instill in me: A sense of wonder - ""What could possibly be in that maze / What could be behind all this / What is the ultimate goal?"" - Questions I haven't really asked myself in other movies because they're usually so straight forward that I either don't care or the answer is trivial. I'd recommend it to anyone who's up to watching a movie that approaches storytelling a bit differently.",1
95,"I am very disappointed in this movie. Comparing this movie to the book is liking saying there was no book at all. I was so excited hearing that there was going to be a movie based on the book. I feel like if there were no book to compare this movie with the movie would have done just fine. There were so many changes to the story in the movie than the story in the book.Changes:1) Thomas and Teresa in the book could communicate through each others minds.2) Instead of them using a camera (or whatever thing they took out of the Grievers) they find a hole that is very well hidden to escape the maze.3)They do not get picked up on a helicopter, instead it was a bus.There are a lot more changes in this movie, but these are the ones that annoyed me the most.Now the sequel is out I don't even plan to see it knowing how the story will probably be about 80% changed from the book just like before, which completely destroys the storyline. Although the acting was great I feel like the movie was not put together as well as it should have.",0
96,This is another film where at least half of the critics have got it wrong. I was so surprised with how good this movie is. Great acting and an intriguing plot make this far superior to the Hunger Games. It doesn't rely on needless violence to succeed and avoids many cliches that seem to cloud a growing number of screenwriters judgement. Haven't read the book which I think has added to my enjoyment.,1
97,"Another YA dystopian novel movie adaptation?!? I’m starting to wonder if the market will become oversaturated with these films (though I doubt it). If you’re just looking for one nice movie to be entertained with, you might be disappointed with TMR because the movie ends with a cliffhanger and is the first in a quartet of books (and probably future movies). It has an interesting premise (Why are the Gladers in the Maze? Who put them there? Will they ever get out?), but to new moviegoers TMR might feel like simple franchise bait and will leave them with more questions than answers about the world of TMR. You might not get much closure. The Gladers are likeable characters, but they aren’t developed much and are too similar to familiar character archetypes. Thomas is an OK character, to be honest Newt and Alby are more interesting than he was. This is probably due to Thomas having no memories, and most of his scenes are ones that set up the series mythology and ones where he’s in fight and chase scenes. The rest of the Gladers don’t do much or are there only to advance the plot of the movie (but they’re likeable). You don’t focus on this much though as The Maze Runner is a very fast-paced book and movie. Thomas and the “Gladers” rush from one shocking event to the next dangerous chase, all while trying to find a way out of the Maze. Even though TMR only has a $34 million dollar budget, the movie still looks visually nice. I loved to see the Grievers, the Maze, the Glade, and the Gladers brought to life from the book! I think they were cast very well: Thomas, Teresa, Alby, Minho, Gally; they all look like I imagined them. To the disappointment of some action, effects-heavy, CGI explosion fans there are no super-big set pieces in TMR, and the fighting is pretty primitive (with almost no guns or heavy hand-to-hand combat sequences). But there’s still excitement with the chases from, and the fighting against the Grievers (bio-mechanical lizard/scorpion-like monsters). TBH the fight scenes could’ve been a bit more professional. There are a few small things changed from book to movie, but most help the movie become a smoother cinematic tale (albeit slightly cliché) and more understandable to those who don’t know all the info that comes with reading the books. However, others are quite unnecessary. The movie ultimately spends too long setting up future installments than fleshing out the characters, but it still has enough things going on for you not to get too bored. It’s adrenaline-fueled, suspenseful, and thrilling. I personally think the fight scenes could’ve been better choreographed and more exciting. Also, the characters really could’ve used more development. I think we should’ve got to known the Maze, Glade, and Gladers more because the movie is IMO too short. PS, for those of you that don’t know, a sequel to TMR (called The Maze Runner: Scorch Trials) is set be released on September 18, 2015 in the United States. Also, a second prequel book has been announced by James Dashner called “The Fever Code” (possibly to be released in 2016).Score for The Maze Runner: 7.4 %%SPOILER ALERT%% Does it really make sense that, with an unlimited budget and support of the world’s governments, WCKD (or WICKED in the books) decided to make a maze of death in an attempt to find a cure for The Flare? If they wanted to study the brain patterns of the Gladers, couldn’t they put them under complex simulations (like in Divergent)? It’d be stupid if they hadn’t invented the technology, because they have “Transvices” and “Flat Trans” (mentioned in the other books) in their world. They have those futuristic devices, but not simulation serums? Also, why do they only measure the killzone (or brains’) reactions to negative things and dangerous situations? What about positive emotions/situations? Wouldn’t those have to be tested too? I personally think the government and scientists would’ve just exterminated all the infected and they all would’ve hid in some bunker. So I think that the Maze Runner is a bit implausible in that regard. But whatever. If you liked this review, please read my other ones on movies, TV shows, and videogames. I have reviewed 32 movies, including the 2014 films: Dracula Untold, The Maze Runner, The Expendables 3, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Guardians of the Galaxy, Sharknado 2, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Transformers: Age of Extinction, Edge of Tomorrow, X-Men Days of Future Past, Godzilla, Blended, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Divergent, Transcendence, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, Blended, The Lego Movie, and more.

98,"The Maze Runner es un film que plasma su idea de una manera interesante y que consigue ser bastante funcional. Esta película, que parte de un concepto interesante, te adentra en un viaje lleno de misterio, pistas sin resolver y piezas a las cuales hay que encajar, además de esa intensidad que da a medida que se va desarrollando, y que en toda su trama deja claro el objetivo que se quiere cumplir: Encontrar una forma del salir del laberinto. Al final, este largometraje no resulta predecible, si no entretenido, con buenas ideas y con los que se aprovecharon muy bien sus menos de 40 millones de dólares de presupuesto y dejándote con ganas de lo que viene a continuación.",1
99,"Bit cheesy and predictable in places but the action sequences are amazing and special affects. It'll leave you wanting to find out what happens next, doesn't talk down to kids and actually very scary in parts, also leaving you gripping the edges of your seat and heart racing, very interesting twist at the end that I hope they'll explain more on and go into the issues of morality of WICKED in the next movie, that was hinted about near the end and generally is a good movie, not the best movie ever but still a pretty good one and one I wouldn't mind watching again. Nothing to scream and shout about but a still a very entertaining watch.",1
