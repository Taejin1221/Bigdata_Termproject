0,"The best thing about Interstellar is that, like Inception, the science and the ideas are as real, as sophisticated, and as advanced, as any ideas out there. If you see a critic or somebody saying this is convoluted or overly complex that says more about their lack of understanding than about the movie. We should be thrilled Nolan is thinking about and making movies about these things. Bravo.",1
1,"Christopher Nolan did it again; Interstellar will twist your mind and fill your heart with love. Interstellar isn't just a massive space-adventure. It's much more than that; it’s a film about human bonding. Interstellar is by far the best sci-fi film of the year, and one of the greatest of all time. The vast storyline about the connection between us humans is so incredible, I felt so attracted to the characters and I almost started crying because it's so dramatic and epic. I usually don't feel so attracted to the characters like in Interstellar, so this was just so incredible! When it comes to the actors and their roles, are they all superb. Matthew McConaughey as Cooper is just fantastic; he's both dramatic and stunning in action. Jessica Chastain and Mackenzie Foy as Murph are both awesome, even a bit touching. One aspect of Interstellar (when it comes to the actors) is that there's one actor I didn't expect to be in this film, so it was a big surprise! There's even some humor between the characters in this film, which I didn't expect. As mentioned, the story is wonderful, but there might be some slow scenes in the end of the first act, but the ending explained it all so there's nothing wrong about it! Interstellar is a film that just kept going and going when I saw it. I thought it would end like 3 or 4 times but instead it just continued with even more exiting and innovated things that I never have seen before. I can tell you this: if you thought Inception was something innovating and spectacular, go and watch Interstellar, you won't regret it! Some people think the last act of the film is less impressive, but I don't agree, it's fantastic! The structure of Interstellar is in my opinion very similar with The Prestige, maybe not as excessive but I totally love it! It's so clear that this is a film by Christopher Nolan, just the visuals are incredible and I was so amazed while watching it. It even looks more real than the film Gravity, and the first 30 minutes of Interstellar is totally superior than Gravity. I couldn't even see if there are CGI in this film, and that there's no 3D is a great thing! There are some minor flaws in the film, and the first thing is the soundtrack. Yes it's from the famous composer Hans Zimmer, and I love his previous works like the music in The Dark Knight Trilogy and in the film Inception. But it's not exactly as massive and touching as I thought it would be. It's still impressive, but not as vast or touching. Another thing is the first act of the film; it felt like they had cut too much scenes, because it felt a bit to fast. There could also have been a bit more action. The last aspect is the trailer, it doesn't spoil much about the film, but I think they should have shown less of the visuals. It could have resulted in even more surprising things with the film. This is the best film from Christopher Nolan to date, but it's not a perfect film. Even though, I don't think we need to wait that long until he creates something even more spectacular than Interstellar. Interstellar get a 9.5/10",1
2,"Music perfectly falls on the picture, the story can not tear myself away from the screen for almost three hours. This is simply the best modern sci-fi film. And don't forget, story based on Kip Thorne works, and theoretically it can be true! ^_^",1
3,"In my opinion, Interstellar certainly lives up to the hype. Words simply can't describe the experience I had while watching this movie unfold before my eyes in that glorious 70 MM Imax format. The visuals were jaw dropping, acting was superb, and the story was filled with originality and hand full of surprises along the way. There is so much to this movie you don't know about when you go into seeing it for the first time, which was a huge plus! The less you know about the story for this movie, the better. While there are a lot of positives for this movie, my only complaint would have to be the pacing of the story. There were a couple instances where I felt like the story was being rushed and that I had to just go along with what was going on at those points. Despite the movie being almost three hours long, I kinda wish it could be a little longer so that the story could progress more naturally. Other than that, I have no other negatives to mention. I walked out of the theater feeling satisfied and wanting to experience it again! And probably will!",1
5,"Not a film about science as we commonly understand it. In fact, Interstellar works hard to convince you to see science in unimagined ways and this (that most critics are using as a reason why the film fails) is its strongest asset. A film with incredible imagination, Interstellar weaves reductive iterations of themes like exploration, love and time together so cohesively that the audience is challenged to see them each with new wonder. Anne Hathaway is given one of her most complex roles to date and her work here is both efficient and subtle. Technically, the editing, cinematography and score all work hard to bring the ideas of the story to new heights.",1
6,"I emplore everyone to put the critics aside and go into this film with an open mind.  It does get pretty science-y but do not let that stop you!  This movie is a brilliant opus to both 2001 (with a MUCH more satisfying climax) not saying the end of 2001 is bad, also another amazing movie.  There is also some subtle points to the movie The Black Hole.  If you have seen both of these, movies then you should get the references.  Jaw-dropping soundtrack!  Cinematography is some of the best that I have seen this year.  I really feel that this is Nolan's love letter to the genre.  The movie is not without fault though, but everything blended so WELL that I still gave it a 10.  I have not had a movie invoke so much emotion as this one did in a long time!  One more thing to note, if you plan on seeing this, please see it in 70MM IMAX!  It just adds to the size and scope of the movie!",1
7,"An absolute visual feast, Interstellar delivers on its promises, and it actually - believe it or not - has a more satisfying ending than 2001.  Not that the story is superior to Kubrick's classic, but there's a heart to it that I did not expect.  I enjoyed the science - it does not talk down to its audience, and I can say I learned a few things.    I especially enjoyed the robots with their matter-of-fact voices/affect.  Though they don't have a human appearance - they initially appear super clunky (until you come to realize what they're capable of) - you instantly feel comfortable with them, which I credit in great part to the incredible voice acting of Bill Irwin.  The father-daughter story is touching - both the young actress and Chastain are tremendous.  McConaughey, if you've seen him in True Detective, does not disappoint.",1
8,"this is other masterpiece movie from Mr.Nolan. the visualy are very stunning and it hase an emotional aspect. Well done Nolan!!! i was blown away for the second time and i will go tomorrow for the thirth time to enjoy his movie in Imax format, because that is the only experience that you can see it in the cinema.",1
10,"I am not a Nolanite. Maybe I'm an anti-Nolanite. I have nothing but contempt for movies about comic book superheroes. I hated Inception. I went into this movie with enough baggage to get me thrown off a plane. It was superb. It was mind-blowing. I'm old. I saw 2001 when it originally came out, when everybody who saw it, came out saying ""WTF?"" Then, people discovered watching 2001 while high - and everything fell into place! During the (controversial) 3rd act, I was back in 2001 (and wondering where I left my bong years before..). I didn't really need to heighten the sensation though, Nolan bombarded the audience with son et lumieres and McConaughey bombarded the audience with the most beautifully wrought portrayal of abject desperation and unconditional love I've ever seen on screen. It broke my heart and I'm cynical as hell. The screenplay was serviceable, the dialogue was atrocious (this is Nolan after all), but it didn't matter. The visuals made Gravity look like it was filmed on an IPhone. The performances? Even Anne Hathaway was fine. Jessica Chastain and Mackenzie Foy, I shall forever revere. But McConaughey? Good God, this man is working on a level unknown to other actors. Absolutely electrifying. Not the Oscar bait that the Academy usually rewards, I think a Nobel Prize is in order. I never suspected a film would come along this year that could threaten my beloved Boyhood's hold on my heart, yet Interstellar comes perilously close.",1
11,"Unlike his usual blockbuster style, Nolan has challenged both himself and the audiences a greater depth in this stunning space opera creatively. Slightly clinched and flawed in term of plot wise, this pure hard science fiction that stresses a lot on Quantum theories, space elements, astrophysics, time, gravity and the rushing, complex and slightly illogical third act might squeeze one's mind in this heavy 3 hours mission, but the worthy and meaningful dialogues, enormous expansion from the universe in Gravity, strong and connecting relationship between father and daughter have overall made the film entertaining, thrilling and thought-provoking. Hans Zimmer﻿ follows the director's effort in terms of scoring, which the musics sound more emotional, calm and creepy rather than the usual loud and powerful style; award-winning cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema did perfect job to present stunning, immersive and state-of-the-art visual effects of the space, wormholes, black hole and unknown planets beyond our galaxy. It might not be the most epic and perfect film, but this love letter from Nolan which is heavily inspired by 2001: A Space Odyssey, sending through the time and gravity somehow represents a rare film that begins and ends so beautifully and stellar.",1
12,"The best sci-fi movie for 2014. It has a mixture of human psychology, drama, sci-fi and actions. I felt the movie was a bit short even if it's almost 3 hours long, extra 15 minutes would do. Good ending and it worth my time in the big screen.",1
14,"I don’t know at what point I stopped caring about the main characters in “Interstellar” but it must have been upon losing all interest as to whether they ’make it’ or don’t. Or it may have been at the one point a crew member is lost and the reaction was, “So what?” The film is long, at 169 minutes, with a lot of forgettable science verbiage that is forgotten by most of the audience before the credits start running. Will even the science nerds in the audience remember the dialogue regarding the black hole or the worm hole? Isn’t it enough to say that  one hour in space will equal 7 hours on earth without getting into quantum theories? I’d rather hear how Anne Hathaway’s hair stays so sculptured after having a space helmet on for a flight, walking in water and on ice plus the gravity experienced, which is talked about but doesn’t seem to affect hairdos! Director Christopher Nolan and co-writer of the script with his brother Jonathan, seem to know what they want to say when dealing with family relationships but when the abruptly take off space they seem to get lost. “Gravity” set the bar high for filming in space and spaceships and “Interstellar” comes nowhere near those scenes and feelings. The Nolans, along with the Director of Photography Hoyte van Hoytema, get the feel, sights and sounds of earth drying up and the possibility of the end of earth is made believable as are the various family relations, but once the movie blasts off to space everything comes to a halt except for a robot that seems more livelier than the humans. The cast do what they can with what they got but Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, former test pilot who is brought back to lead this mission to find a place that the humans on earth can move to before they die, is fine in the father and daughter scenes but does not bring much to the hero aspect of the film. Oh, and a side note, he does need to put on some of the  weight he lost for “Dallas Buyers Club”. Anne Hathaway has a thankless part while Michael Caine as her father gets to repeat Dylan Thomas”s poem “Do not go gentle into that good night” a few times. Murph, Cooper’s daughter, is played by 3 actresses and as the 10 year old Mackenzie Foy is a stand out while Jessica Chastain as Murph in her 30s has nothing to do but being angry. David Gyasi and Wes Bently as the crew working with McConaughey and Hathaway, along with computerized robot voiced by Bill Irwin, are more than adequate. They are 3 other actors, not to be named, in the film so as not to provide spoilers. Also Casey Affleck, as Murph’s brother, in an underwritten role does what he can with it. Ah yes I must give credit to Hans Zimmer for the too often loud music, signifying nothing, for keeping me awake in the last hour of “Interstellar”.",0
15,"Here we go again reviewing yet another failed giant which clocks in at a butt numbing 169 minutes. It's an ambitious but flawed venture that is big in concept, big in budget and explores  big themes. Sadly what this all adds up to is a big disappointment. The story, full of as many holes as there are black ones in space, is a mish mash of ideas which never really gel and one never quite gets a hold of what the point of it all is. The actors don't offer much by way of compensation either. Anne Hathaway shouldering the worst of the dialogue is the biggest casualty here, but Michael Caine is also tiresome as is Matt Damon who adds nothing. Matthew McConnaughey is better, but whatever emotion or empathy the film generates, and there are some very moving moments, are purely due to the wonderful Jessica Chastain. The film's biggest asset is her performance, although it's good to see film legend Ellen Burstyn showing all the others how it's done in just one tiny scene. The banal dialogue is often gibberish and causes the rolling of one's eyes in disbelief or embarrassment. Nearly all scenes are over extended and often one is inclined to tune out long before they are finished. The special effects are good, but aside from a couple of sequences (a huge wave and the final set piece involving McConnaughey and Chastain),there really isn't much that we haven't seen before. The music comes on strong and sounds like an extended version of Mike Oldfield's 'Tubular Bells' from 1973's 'The Exorcist', co incidentally starring Burstyn in one of her finest roles. The sound is very loud and effective during the set pieces, but is then often inaudible during simple dialogue exchanges between characters. I have no idea what Anne Hathaway was mumbling at the end in so pained a manner.There are some marvellous compositions of the outside of the spacecraft filmed in complete silence, which are then judiciously cut with the sound included inside the ship. More of this and less dialogue would have been appreciated all round. Another gimmick that serves little purpose was the almost inevitable inclusion of the robot TARS. I would have recommended the removal of his power pack. Director Christopher Nolan is certainly full of ideas but, unfortunately, they are never fully realised. He comes over like a young boy trying to communicate a passion or a hobby that no one else gets. His direction is over indulgent and left me confused and bored. Perhaps after two dramatic failures (Inception was very similar in style, but an even worse film!) he should try his hand at comedy. After all laughter in a cinema in infinitely preferable to sleeping.",0
16,"The more you know, the stupider this film seems. If you passed any high-school science class or played Kerbal Space Program for a few hours, you will want to retch. Some of the SFX will impress people who think loud music means drama. This is a fraud, an insult to the notion of science fiction.",0
17,"*** spoilers *** While visually stunning, this is one of the most flawed films in recent memory. Flawed, because more time was spent rendering out the special effects than developing a screenplay worthy of the cast and budget. When you're a filmmaker who can make anything you want - on film - there is no excuse for your films to not bring something new to the table and work at a basic screenplay level. Interstellar does not ask new questions and with a script that literally feels like a first draft --I'm just shocked that Nolan didn't develop this more. The entire core of this film is the relationship between our lead Cooper and his daughter - but this is so rushed and honestly, extremely cheesy, that we don't care what happens. They spend far too much in time in space - with a ridiculous plot involving Matt Damon - and cut back to Earth is sporadic cuts that pull us into so many directions. There is no focus in this film. This film proves that the Nolan brothers can not handle a couple of things: writing females and writing emotional characters that we're attached to. The dialogue was laughable - over the top in many places - and basically just a ton of one-liners. We cut from Cooper learning he has to go to space - says goodbye - boom on the rocket - NO ATTACHMENT. There is zero development here - just get him to space, which fails to tell the core story well - which bites this movie in its ass in the third act. There are countless films that do this way better - Apollo 13, Close Encounters (they don't even go to space there) - if you want the audience to care about your characters then you have to spend more time making them care - not as much with the science and pizzaz - and I know everyone will love this movie, but it's not just minor flaws here - it's gaping holes in both motivation and development. Forced. Rushed. However you want to put it - I'm sorry folks - it's not a great movie - not even a good one. Everything is spoon fed to the audience - no, not just the science - the twists - I didn't know on the nose screen writing was so acceptable in Hollywood - guess it is. They talk about ghosts so many times within the first act that anyone with half a brain KNEW there was something there - and if you know anything about space travel, black holes - or any of the stuff that is talked about in the trailers - you can put two and two together and call the major twist in the FIRST ACT. I literally turned to my girlfriend and called it - as did the other 5 people we were with... And yes - I understood all the underlying themes and motifs he was playing with - love/gravity etc - but it wasn't enough to save a script where the characters aren't given room to breath.",0
18,"My first review for Metacritic. inspired to join to record my disappointment  with this film.  And I wasn't the only  one. People were leaving to go to loo thoughout the film, often a bad sign.  I honestly thought the film was 4 hours long.  Long scenes of boring dialogue.  Like other reviewers, I found it astonishing that one astronought would have to explain to another  what a worm hole was. And the robot was so unweildly. We conveniently skipped how it got in and out of the spacecraft. I love a good space movie. But give me Moon, Gravity or Apollo 13 any day.",0
19,"3 Of Us Fell Asleep, 6 Of Us - Out Of 7 - Hated It! That's the score from a group of 7 friends who went to see Interstellar tonight. If I hadn't been with friends I would have walked out! The only friend who liked it said she enjoys soap operas. That pretty much sums it up! IF YOU LIKE SOAP OPERAS YOU WILL LOVE INTERSTELLAR! There are so many plot holes several of us were cracking jokes by the end of the movie. So many parts of Interstellar are so ridiculous or makes no sense -whatsoever- it borders on camp. Sure the cinematography is magnificent. But in the end it's nothing but pretty wallpaper when the story is drawn out, tedious, annoying, maudlin, nonsensical, irrelevant, dopey and depressing. (I heard way too many violins in the soundtrack! LOL!) All I can say is when the only food humanity has left to eat is corn & corn products, then you are going to end up with a very corny movie!",0
20,"Terrible performances and even worse writing, filled with gaping plot holes and over wrought direction.  It's a clunky mess of film.  Such a shame.  It had so much potential.",0
21,"it is simply a beautiful film with a lot of tension, action and deep that leaves the viewer with something in the heart that rejoices enough and leaves him with ""hope"" Hans Zimmer soundtrack is beautiful and great direction and script.Also very good special effects.scientific accuracy and good sound mix.that almost was not nominated for anything at the Golden Globes?",1
22,"This is easily one of the best movies ever created.! Every aspect of the film is incredible well done, the story is deep and has many twists that will surprise you, the soundtrack is perfect, that is the word, perfect.! From the very beginning it gives you a sense of mystery that won't disappear until the end of the film. The development of the characters is great, with a masterful performance by McConaughey. Interstellar is a unique and special movie, one that you will want to see many times, and that you will never forget, a masterpiece.!",1
23,"Interstellar is visually stunning, not only in space but on earth as well. On top of that Hans Zimmer's score is absolutely brilliant and one of my favourites ever. The only problem I had with this movie is the ending. Without going into spoilers I just would have preferred a different ending that could have still worked within the movie. That doesn't mean the ending didn't work, or wasn't good, just not what I would have went with. This still is a must see movie, on the biggest screen with the best sound possible. It is a humanizing, grounded, yet ambitious and exceptional in almost every way.",1
24,"While there is perhaps some plot ""confusion"" in the film, Interstellar is a visceral and visual space epic thats scope is as big as the universe its characters reach. Nolan shoots and scores as he combines emotion and science fiction seamlessly and tells a wonderfully impactful story. Perhaps its only flaw is that its material can be a lot comprehend at times but, in the end, the story comes full circle. Outstanding.",1
25,"Although the plot seems to delve into ridiculous solutions at times, making up a few ex machinas to somehow cover up the deeply tangled and complicated storyline the movie sets itself into, Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" is a stellar movie with the typical Nolan-signature styled choreography and amazing visuals, a great soundtrack, and an excellent performance from Matthew McConaughey, where in some scenes he literally brought me to tears in.",1
26,"Personally I felt Interstellar was a great film that sometimes struggled to get to the point. Graphically the film is one of the best of its kind, It also really makes you the feel that the clock is ticking. Its a film that keeps you on the edge of you seat right until the end. You never know which way it will go. Also Nolan left the ending on a slight cliff hanger so potentially a 2nd Interstellar may be on the books. It is a complex film but Space is a complex subject. Nolan took this film to a whole new level, making you want to know more & leaving you wanting a second film.",1
27,"One of the best movies I've seen. I've seen some very positive and some very negative ratings but after all, this is a movie I will never forget in my lifetime not only because of the soundtrack!",1
28,"Interstellar is a mind-blowing movie, there is no way to summarize it in  order to convince the audience to go see it. The next work of Christopher  Nolan arrives with much more strength than Inception, not only because we  jump from dreams to space, but also because is noticeable the consolidation  that reached this director. First is the setting of the story, the life of  mankind in the Earth has come to an end, although the interesting thing is  how Nolan shows it, from the point of view of a family. Here it is clear  the importance that acquires the human side in the story (which is also  present in Nolan's filmography), and this theme from the beginning to the  end is the protagonist. Some examples are the decision that Cooper has to  make, whether going to space but miss seeing his children grow or stay; and  the other one is probably the most heartbreaking scene of the movie, when  the protagonist sees the compilation video (astonishing performance btw).  This whole thing aims to evaluate human behavior, sometimes subconsciously  (Inception, Memento) and others rationally (Interstellar), but both about  survival instincts. Another amazing things about the picture are: the  visual effects, obviously, how the crew gather the current info and  theories about the aspect of a real dark hole; second, how it exhibits the  concept of relativity; and finally, the representation of time as a  tangible dimension. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat for nearly  3 hours, definitely nothing like what has been seen before.",1
29,What else could you want from a movie? Christopher Nolan outdid himself with this gem. Matthew McConaughey was stunning in this film as well. Interstellar will take you to places unseen by the human eye. Great visual effects and a heartwarming and emotionally-invested story added with superb acting makes this by far my favorite film of 2014.,1
30,"One of the best movies I've seen in years. Beautiful both in visuals and sound and has from what I've seen probably the most accurate representation of current theories in astrophysics in action ( except right at the end where they go into really unknown territory ). Also that soundtrack deserves a reward by itself.",1
31,"Well, one off from two of this year's most expected movies alongside 'The Battle of Five Armies'. Like all the Chris Nolan fans, I was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. But I slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3D film. I agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. All the credit must go to Nolan brothers. A good sign from Jonathan Nolan, who can make big in the entertainment industry in a future like his brother. As we know many had liked 'Inception', to me that was a simple multi-layered action movie, that's all. But the same stuffs that used in this film makes sense. In fact, you have to have a little knowledge over how the universe works, so then it will be easy to catch the scene and situations while watching the movie. Totally like a documentary style concept, but with the additional stuffs like characters and its emotions add flavor that gives a movie look. An educational movie, though it also can work for those who wants just entertainment. Only the slow movie pace would test their patience. It was the story of a family alongside the future of humankind and decoding universal mysteries through travelling in space and time. This movie would a reasonable for those who thought '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a boring piece, Cleverly written cinematic piece especially for science geeks. I don't know how perfect the movie to the actual present astrophysics, but will justify for the common people's capacity of understanding with an encourageable amount of commercial elements in it to entertain as well. The first three quarters of the movie was well made. It puts me in a unblinkable position like a story was narrated by Brian Cox in a television series. Like I said, lots of astrophysics involved in it, but strangely human emotions were also exhibited equally that I never expected one from Nolan film. It was not an ordinary sentiment, but was strong enough to make a man cry for happy and sad situations in the movie. I liked science and emotion coming together. In fact, it saved the movie, otherwise it would have been a science documentary straight from NASA production through Nolan direction. There are many surprise elements in the movie and of course there is a twist at the end. We can call it a series of twists like the layers. Compared to last quarter of the movie to the rest, it completely detaches which opens broadly to the different directions. And that happens so fast rushing towards the other end. Which give an impression of the movie 'Inception'. In a perfect way to say the first 75% was 'The Tree of Life' and the remains are 'Inception'. The story was initiated with a realistic approach with actual scientific contents as per the present understanding about the universe. But the end was let me down with the layered contents that kind of impossible to agree with it. As a cinematic theme it worked, yeah, a good solution for this wonderfully written story. We know that the time can't run backwards, so that's the trouble. Anyway, this movie defines in a new way, I mean scientifically the existence of ghost. It was not a horror movie, but I liked supernatural force that merged with this science fiction theme. That explains and gives vast ideas to expand our physics beyond something and somewhere yet to reach. Hats off to the director, because he was not thinking of making money here. His idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. And he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions. In my opinion, this will replace '2001: A Space Odyssey' for sometime till another one make this way. The visuals were not that great, but simply very good. To see those in digital 3D would have given us a different experience, sadly Nolan was not in favor of that technology. Hoping this movie would get as many as the Oscars nod. Especially not getting into the best motion picture shortlist would be a shame. Like I said I'm no one fan, I just love watching everyone's every movie. I would have went to see it again if it was converted into digital 3D, since I'm modern tech geek when it comes to the films. The end scene leaves a hint of a possible sequel. I would be happy if that happen in a near future, but definitely that would be a completely different cinema as per how this one ended. I know his fans want that to happen and so am I. What I gonna say is it is a must see asap if you are a movie fanatic like me otherwise Nolan movies does not need anyone's recommendation because his movies usually sell itself like the hot samosa.",1
32,"A magnificently mounted piece of popular entertainment - a bold and ambitious old school science fiction adventure film bound to inspire budding filmmakers much the same way Close Encounters of the Third Kind 2001 and Star Wars did back in those days.Hans Zimmer usually bombastic in his work, is unusually intimate and powerful here delivering one of the great cinematic scores.Matthew McConaughey fresh from his Oscar  streak is the film's beating heart: complex, tragic, heroic, and charismatic.With filmmaking this epic, intelligent and emotional, belongs among the stars.",1
33,"Amazing movie. The art direction and cinematography was fantastic. It reminded me a great deal 2001: A Space Odyssey. A lot of time is spent setting tone, and artfully describing the environment - which helps with the overall mood of thoughtful contemplation. And while the overall plot may be grandiose and reaching at times, the story itself remains very human and centered. One of the better films I've seen this year. I highly recommend it.",1
34,"Is ""Interstellar"" a significant cinematic achievement? I don't know. I do know it's the best ""hard scifi"" thing I've seen in a while. I loved this movie. I will admit though - there were times I envied the crew their stasis pods for skipping over some of the longer, less interesting, stretches of the trip.",1
35,"A nice Sci-Fi movie with a serious plot and gloomy atmosphere. I didn't like the final part of the movie much, but still the effort is very solid. The actors are great, Matt Damon has a small but memorable role. A must see for all Sci-Fi fans.",1
36,"This Movie is Great about Story, Effect, and Music. For Character is look good too, and salute for Nolan, keep keeping men for make Quality Film ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////",1
37,"Good ol fashion Nolan.  The only films he made that I didnt really care for are Batman Begins and The Dark Knight Rises.  This one is not quiet as powerful as Inception was, but it was still a pretty good ride.  There are a lot of parallels you could draw from Space Odyssey 2001, but the film has its own signature look and many of the creative decisions feel organic.  It runs it a little long and some may feel the philosophy towards the end is a tad bit hokey.  Overall B+.",1
38,"I approached this film with trepidation after reading a lot of the negative reviews, but having seen it, I felt compelled to add to the growing praise it has received. This is one of the most awe-inspiring films I have seen for a long time. The emotional development of the characters was just perfect, and while certain plot developments were dropped into conversations earlier in the film, I can understand why this was done. It was to aid people who seem unable to comprehend complicated plot structure, in this respect Nolan failed, as a lot of people still seemed to be in the dark. This film is sci-""fi"", so the third act, however fantastical, was not meant to be grounded in reality. Even so, the tesseract created by our descendants, and their ability to manipulate gravity and consequently time, alludes to unfathomable technology from our current technological viewpoint. The black hole could have been an artificial construct used as a teaching tool to transfer knowledge from a 5th to a 3rd dimensional being. Time being represented as a ""physical"" environment in this 5th dimensional space, such as the 2 dimensional wormhole was represented as a sphere in 3 dimensional space. From the visuals (which were just awe-inspiring) to the decision to allow atmospheric sound and music to mask the dialogue in places, representing either the immensity of the situation or the sheer emotional trauma at such points. I love that in this day and age, a Hollywood director could create such a piece which transcends the mundanity of daily (current) societal games and norms, and directs our gaze to the ineffable majesty of a greater reality which exists all around us. I can't wait to watch this again.",1
39,"Incredible vision and creativity in this film. That is ultimately why I love watching films so much -  I want them to make me think, and go to places I've never been before. To get some things out of the way - yes, this film is very similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I wouldn't say it is as good. There are small weaknesses  which keep it from being a perfect 10/10 on my list, but it is still one of the best sci-fi movies. The plot seems  to be very well written for the most part, especially the science. You can tell they did their research. The use of scientific concepts like gravity and time distortion (or w/e you call it) was very unique and cool, and I really like that we got a glimpse inside a black hole - of course we don't know what is really inside, but its cool to explore one possibility. There were some small things I didn't like - for example, I still don't know how I feel about the concept of ""love"" as some space/time transcending force - it sounded a bit cheesy. But on the whole this film dazzled me with its scope and creativity.",1
40,"This is another classic Nolan film.  It was extremely well acted and well written.  Of course, with any film this ambitious, some things are not going to click with some viewers.  The concepts in this film are often unbelievable, but that's the point.  Some confusing story lines could have been better defined, but any sci-fi fan can enjoy this film.",1
41,"Interstellar was nothing short of a spectacle... a grandiose experience of epic proportions. It explores concepts no movie has ever explored before, and fleshes them out exceptionally. The movie has multiple moments of unmatched intensity, like when Mathew McConaughey's character Cooper must dock his ship onto a rapidly rotating space station, or when the Crew of four, including Cooper and Anne Hathaway's character, Dr. Brand (plus a couple somewhat unremarkable characters) travel through a worm hole into the unknown. The main characters are sculpted well and detailed, and the characters are somewhat relatable and their wonderful acting gives a good sense of realistic emotion shown. Although the movie takes a bit to get started (the initial take-off sequence was decently boring) and a few of the characters fail to be interesting, the movie was overall fantastic. The ending sequence was one of the most incredible things I have ever seen in a movie since Nolan seems to think like me. Only difference being, I imagine someone looking across time pictured as a bubble, rather than a sprawling plane of individual time periods spread out in front of you. Nontheless, a must see. Especially if you liked Gravity, Contact, or any other space movies. In fact, any Nolan fans out there should see it as well, as it has a heavy theme of human emotion and reaction to odd situations, found in other Nolan films like Inception. Seriously, go see it.",1
42,"Simply incredible, mind-twisting and mind-blowing. Space scenes are realistic and Christopher Nolan really wanted the audience to feel inside the movie, to be part of the journey. There are indeed a few minor flaws (I would be stupid not to admit it) but it doesn't matter, this movie still deserves a 10 for everything it offers.",1
43,"This is a great movie.  It ignores some of our current understanding of science and takes some of our unproven theories and runs with them.  So as long as you can accept that, you should be in for a wild ride! Incredible visuals mixed in with a solid, if not great, story.  Unlike most sci-fi movies, you can actually get invested in the characters here, and for the most part the movie avoids stereotypical roles.  It makes for some emotional scenes.  There's a sense of ""gravity"" to the situation (heh!) and you can feel it! It's a long movie, but aside from the slow start you never really feel it.  Another great movie by Nolan!",1
44,THIS movie is great and the best of 2014! The actors were good and so was the plot. However the movie lost me at the black hole part. I understood it but it was just too weird. So no 10 only 9 ;:3,1
45,"Interstellar is a film about, above everything else, humanity's need for exploration. It's hard to miss this fact, what with all of Matthew McConaughey's monologues on the topic in the film's first half hour or so. The blighted, dying future Earth is practically a metaphor for its navel-gazing population, so blind to the fact that they're literally farming themselves to death that they actually rewrote the history books to discourage wasteful wanderlust. So it comes as little surprise that explorers are the ones plotted to save the species in spite of itself. However, getting past the heavy-handed setup is worth it, because once the crew of Interstellar's interstellar vessel takes off, so does the movie. The visuals are always great and sometimes amazing. The care with which the film's universe is rendered is apparent. Kip Thorne, Interstellar's science adviser, really earned his paycheck here. The actual science is less perfect, but if you can ignore all the hand-waving at the beginning and ending of the film, the rest might actually teach you a thing or two. It goes without saying with a cast like this that the performances are all solid, including an unexpectedly disturbed turn by Matt Damon. Christopher Nolan shoots this film in signature stylistic fashion, and his musical right-hand man Hans Zimmer provides a suitably rousing score. The ending is more than a little derivative, but it serves.",1
46,"Not long ago, I watched a featurette with excerpts from the movie Interstellar, which showed the gargantuan amount of work and sweat Nolan brethren, Kip Thorne and others put in whilst exploring the behaviour of a black hole. The crisp attention and the minute details they did not overlook flabbergasted me beyond limit. So hopeful was written all over my head. And Nolan never disappoints. Strewn with science, this movie not only takes you on a joy ride, it educates you as well. The concept of space-time singularity pervades throughout the flick as we witness a superb simulation of a black hole, and it doesn't stop at just that. We go into it. Yes, through the eyes of our protagonist for the first time, we witness a distinct theoretical world that has found pragmatism. An impeccable representation of Tesseract with threads of time. The best thing about Nolan is the enormity of the project he takes. The script is so beautifully written that it rivets you right from the start. The concept is like magic, a miracle happening in a distant galaxy. As the story unfolds it makes you feel as if you are getting closer to finding answers to our existence finally. The plot however has something else in store for you. And it is a big fat blunt satire on our loneliness. We are alone and all we have is each other. That is the penultimate truth. Wormhole was never explored like this before. How time plays tricks on you, powerful representation of anomalies, the wickedness of human mind when left alone in despair(that #Damon bit), how the music of nature (the rain, the thunder and the cricket chirping noise) makes you feel home, the conundrum of our purpose, the humour of TARS, the physics that touches almost every part in the flick, the poetry of the brave and wise through Dylan Thomas's words, superb lamenting conversations, and the brain-wrecking revelations in the end - every little detail has been exemplified with proper logical explanations and shown on a platter of sensations. Emotional surge is strong, and with a power pack performance by McConnaughey everything uplifts. Bits of a father-daughter melodrama are the most feeling kind. Shatters you from the inside, as you empathize with the protagonist's tears. Zimmer touches your heart with his profound score. Notes are so brilliant that they put you right into the flick. This too would sit amongst Zimmer's best works. It is one of the most ambitious projects that would be remembered in impending debates for the intricacies it touches and the science it explores. Nolan is certainly one of a kind director, a great gift to mankind, a wise man who wouldn't go gentle into that good night. Kudos to yet another mammoth achievement!",1
47,"Interstellar is a spectacular viscerally and emotionally powerful sci-fi movie-going experience that demands full immersion. Like all Nolan's movies, its strongest qualities are a uniquely thought-provoking and grand plot with a centered emotional heart peppered with poignant one-liners that force the audience to question the world and their place in it. Also like most Nolan movies, its weaker parts are comprised of somewhat contrived and sloppy dialogue and questionable pacing. Some have expressed distaste with the amount of exposition as well, however I am less inclined to fault a movie with such large and far reaching ideas for packaging these ideas in a way the audience will at least to some degree understand. In a 3 hour movie you don't have the time to fully flesh out ideas naturally that may be completely foreign to the audience, thus heavier than normal exposition is needed to make sure the they are properly strapped in for the ride. The audiovisual experience of Interstellar (especially on an IMAX screen) is bar none. Perhaps only Avatar and Gravity could be said to be on a similar plane, but given the great attention to scientific detail of the subject matter here and the fact that recreating Black and worm holes has actually given rise to breakthroughs is studies on the subjects puts Interstellar in a league of its own. The story is as ambitious as they come for this day and age. There has not been, and is not likely soon be, another movie of this scope and originality in a blockbuster format (with A-list actors performing at their best and a nearly $200 million budget). Detailing more would be a disservice (though at this point you've likely read more elsewhere), but suffice to say it is truly exciting that a movie like this could be made. Like most things, what you get out of Interstellar will likely come from what you expect out of it. If you're looking for plot holes you'll find them (though debate could rage on for days about whether they're really holes or can be explained by current or possible future science). If you're looking for constant hi-octane action you won't find that here. If you're expecting neatly put together dialogue and characters you're likely to be disappointed, because that's not what Nolan's about. Interstellar, like his other movies, is about stretching what a movie going experience (and indeed reality itself) can be. It is best viewed with an open and contemplative mind and wide eyes and ears. It offers a glimpse of the universe we've not previously perceived, and it can spawn threads of thought that otherwise may not have found footing while taking you on a grandly entertaining narrative journey. If that is valuable to you, then Interstellar will offer up one of the best movie-going experiences that can be had.",1
48,É o meu filme favorito da vida! Queria desver o filme pra poder sentir o que senti tudo de novo.,1
49,"Very good sci-fi movie. Comparable to Space Odyssey, but much more appealing to today's reality of space travel. Diverse plot, and current action over multiple locations. Might seen a bit spread out and confusing, yet keeps attention to the very end. However I have to subtract 2 points because of authors making science their b****.  It is ironical especially if we put it against the movie plot. Make a 100% accurate move, or 0% like Star Wars. Pretending to be accurate, stating on law of physics and braking it in the next scene is really silly to watch.",1
50,"“Interstellar” is truly an epic, not in the sense of what we initially think of as an epic, for example “Ben Hur” or perhaps even “2001: A Space Odyssey” (a film which it is worth pointing out I haven’t seen), but more in the sense of how when I think back to “Interstellar”, I think of those visually captivating shots of black, of the unknown and of those desolate landscapes made of water and ice, and how I found myself in awe of them. It is these that come to define “Interstellar”.Set in the near future, Earth cannot sustain humanity anymore, and it’s worth praising Nolan’s subtle view of it, be it seeing the New York Yankees playing on an amateur field or discovering that the Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union, which Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey) denies. This scene, whilst allowing for a sense of character development in regards to Cooper, in retrospect seems to be Nolan emphasising how he sticks to the traditional elements of film and he does so more than ever in this film, from building several rooms of a spaceship from scratch to using five industrial fans to create a dust storm, thus attributing even more of the credit for the film to him.Yet as I expected, it proves very difficult for members of this all-star cast to break through both the visually stunning shots and the label of Christopher Nolan, and be noticed. Only McConaughey succeeds in doing so, although Mackenzie Foy (playing a young Murphy) and Bill Irwin (voicing the robot, TARS) deserve mentions, as does to an extent Michael Caine (playing Professor Brand) and his recital of Dylan Thomas’ “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night”, although I still don’t entirely understand its inclusion, leaving big names such as Casey Affleck (playing Tom) and even Jessica Chastain (playing Murphy) “down in the dirt”.Interstellar is a quintessentially Nolan film, meant to be seen on IMAX, imposing those classic Nolan themes of love and family whilst asking questions that I have not seen asked before, in this case winding up the scientists, although it is interesting to note that Nolan answers them by playing with several theories, instead of just getting the science completely wrong, as is so common. Yet the film is so Nolan that it takes that extra unnecessary step that Nolan always has present in his work, be it taking the audience to Limbo in Inception or by adding the twist of Miranda Tate (played by Marion Cotillard) turning out to be Talia al Ghul in The Dark Knight Rises.Before I conclude, I think it is important to make this point in regards to Nolan and his (future) works. He has begun, whether he means it or not, to dwarf his own cast and to an extent his own themes and his commitment to traditional film elements. The amount of hype that goes into his films is widespread and if he isn’t careful, his future works could take a turn for the worse.As I have already said, Nolan always takes that extra unnecessary step, one that I don’t think I would be so sympathetic with if it was another director, yet the brilliance of what comes before it makes up for it, often leaving me in that No Man’s Land of whether the film was worth 9 or 10 stars.",1
51,"Interstellar is a spectacle, it combines raw emotion with the extreme sights of space travel. The plot of the film is simple, Matthew Mcconaughey must travel through a wormhole with Anne Hathaway and his crew into another galaxy in order to find a new home for mankind, as the planet is dying. Cooper (Mcconaughey's character) must choose to leave behind his young children in order to possibly save them from having a terrible future, due to lack of food and dust storms. The science is fairly spot on, and tries to explain the properties of black holes, worm holes and gravity to the viewer, in order to understand what is going on. The visuals in this film are superb, along with the audio, although at times the audio did seem a little off early in the film during the scenes on earth. The one thing that really grabbed my attention, was the original design of the robots on the spacecraft, TARS and CASE. Robotically I have never seen a design similar to theirs, the way they walk, control things and help the humans is truly amazing. The acting is strong throughout, however some may find the use of sentiment and certain emotional scenes to be possibly cheesy or over the top in some cases. Overall a great space epic, about emotion, family, science and sentiment that leaves you leaving the cinema in awe.",1
52,"Interstellar is a great movie with an interesting plot, amazing soundtrack, and a mind-blowing ending that made the movie for me. The movie is set in the far future, when earth is suffering from a massive scale crop blight, and corn is the only crop that grows anymore. NASA Pilot whose name I forgot, is sent to the deep vacuum of space to find a planet that Humanity can repopulate on. The movie is very gripping and the soundtrack is excellent. Watch this movie now.",1
53,The most realistic science fiction can get! Christopher Nolan with another classic!,1
54,"Christopher Nolan continues to prove to be one of the best directors working in Hollywood today with ""Interstellar"", a breathtaking sci-fi drama with deep characters, amazing story line, and a satisfying ending.",1
55,"This film is beyond amazing. I loved the score of this film including 'First Step' and 'Confield Chase'. Even though it's almost 3-hour long, you will not get bored. May be that's because Cooper said, 'S.T.A.Y'",1
56,"Interstellar has all the stuff that's needed for becoming a real legend. Great visuals, interesting character design and a fascinating story. If you like movies like ""2001:A Space Odyssey"" then you will love Interstellar.",1
57,"Nolan takes you on a journey of beauty and serenity, travelling the vast depths of interstellar travel with undertones of reaping emotion and intensity, it's a a nearby perfected masterpiece. Driven with ambition, and with the backbone of such a stellar cast and nail biting dramatic score, Interstellar could potentially be this year's biggest movie and is expected to rack up a couple of Oscars in the process.",1
58,"Very enjoyable film that actually is worth the 10$ ticket.Excellent cast, sophisticated ideas and plot.After nearly 3 hours of watching this film I was still begging for more.",1
59,"One of, if not the best movie I have seen in 2014. I don't mind that they are quite liberal with their scientific explanations. Who cares? It is not meant to be ralistic, it is meant to be entertaining and hell it was.The only thing that was too hollywood was the cheesy ""love travels time and space""-thing. The movie would have worked completely without this pseudo deep message. Anyway, it was a great movie and recommand to anyone who enjoys scifi drama.If you are looking for a scientifically accurate documentation like space movie, you are wrong here.",1
60,"For ""Interstellar"", Christopher Nolan had inspiration on Stanley Kubrick's ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"", and gat's it just okay. A human story about science, relationships and love. Nolan mix all these three ingredients and gets ""Interstellar"". It's beautiful, superb and extremely realistic. All those years of research about gravity, worm holes and black holes were worth it. The second time you watch this movie, it will be better then the first one. Enjoy the ride.",1
61,"I, personally, found this movie breathtaking. I will not try to impress anyone with Webster's Dictionary cited words, unlike many of these reviews. This movie was thoroughly thought out and must have taken a great deal of creativity and research. A large deal of the negative reviews for this movie are pointing out scientific ""inaccuracies"". I can understand how someone who strongly believes in a certain theory may dislike the claims this movie, but those claims are what make this movie wonderful. Space is impossible to truly comprehend, No human has ever been through a wormhole, nor inside a black hole therefore they cannot judge Nolan's theories of these things for they can only attempt to dispel them with theories of their own.",1
62,"This movie was slow, but because it was well written and had good sound design and special effects, I'll let it slide.This is a mst see for any sci fi fan out there",1
63,"Visually it's stunning, but the space epic that is Interstellar just doesn't stand up, to not only other great films of the genre, but to the films in the repertoire of Christopher Nolan. The concept is complex but just doesn't leave the viewer asking questions for months to come. The run-time is indeed very long but isn't what holds the movie back. The performances by the cast including the incredible Jessica Chastain and Oscar winners Mathew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway are great but not as memorable as one might expect except for maybe Mconaughey. It's complex and emotional and has a great meaning but just not there with the classics, similar to Nolan's last effort The Dark Knight Rises its enjoyable and is definitely worth watching but just doesn't hit the bar that is where we know a Nolan film can go.",1
64,"The visual effects are astonishing! It was so glorious to look at! However, I found the plot to be confusing at times but the father/daughter relationship was really well done and I was emotionally invested in the two.",1
65,"This was an extremely enjoyable movie, but it was not perfectly made. The biggest flaws lie in the acting. Matthew McConaughey looked like he was having a stroke every time that he cried, and when Matt Damon cried, it was also very unrealistic. I also did not enjoy some of the visual effects, as some (like the docking sequences) looked like kids playing with toys. I really also feel that the ending was sort of rushed, like they were getting too close to three hours, so they had to cut it off. There are many positives to this film, however. Jessica Chastain, who I do not usually enjoy, delivered a really good performance. The score by Hans Zimmer was amazing. I also loved some of the scientific explanations given. I did not see a lot of the twists that came in the plot, and that is unusual. Overall, this enjoyable film has its flaws and strengths, and deserves a watch from everyone.",1
66,"Power, emotional, and philosophica - this film is very creative. It may not work around all the egdes, but it's definately worth watching. However, it's not an explosive, high adventure, type of movie. It's an emotional melodrama that may leave you wanting to cry at the end, especially if you understand how strong a father, daughter relationship can be.",1
67,"Is this a sci-fi? A love story? An action movie? In Interstellar, Christopher Nolan combines all of these into a thrilling adventure across the universe to find the Earth a new home.This seamless combination of a visually spectacular action movie, a father-daughter relationship stretched across the universe and an epic sci-fi makes Interstellar one of the most ambitious films in history.This is without even mentioning the scientific attention to detail that Nolan, his team and Prof. Kip Thorne put into the screenplay. The theories which amounted to Interstellar's thoroughly engaging narrative were all remarkably realistic once you'd put your head around it, and any idea which seemed unfeasible at first was justified in the book that accompanied Interstellar's release.Although the ending of Interstellar could be seen as inappropriate for the plot, you could just as easily argue that it was necessary for rounding the action off and making it appeasing for those whom find the Cooper's love for his children the centrepiece of the story. Still, it could have been better as an ending, but given that everything else in the movie is pretty damn awesome we can let it slide.Nolan was aiming for Interstellar to sit amongst his favourite sci-fi '2001: A Space Odyssey', and they show many similarities in that regard. However, Nolan's ability to attract all audiences and mould genres together to form a beautiful, engaging story which remains both challenging (in a good way) and interesting throughout puts Interstellar at the forefront of science fiction movies to date. It becomes one of those movies that sticks with you for years; and I hope it has the same effect on others it did on me.",1
68,"I know this movie was given poor reviews being judged by its' scientific improbability and was made fun of but this movie's story-line was outstanding and the special effects were great. How about judging it on the story instead of it being scientifically impossible! What ever happened to watching a movie because it was a great story, well this story brought me into it and I felt the emotions they put out there. So enjoy!",1
69,"Fantastic artists that helps Nolan to give him a chance to use practical FX instead of green screen/CG, but Interstellar is random in it's own storyline and it does have a good atmosphere that shows us about space. Space is relaxing to watch like Kubrick's 2001, that was fully practical.",1
70,This is undeniably my favorite movie the composition of everything is true perfection in the creation that it is a true modern classic right before your eyes cinematic done right,1
71,"My second favourite movie of all time! Christopher Nolan never dissapoints you! This is a very complex movie, so if you want to watch it you need to prepare yourself to have full atention because if you miss something, you won't understand the movie! Visuals are one of the most stunning effects I have ever seen on screen! The Gargantua (the Black hole), planets, Endurance (the space ship), and that water mountain, aka the Wave, that was the best scene in the movie! So if you want to watch it, you need to see it in IMAX!",1
72,"A Great Sci-fi Adventure film.  The film has great visuals and sound.  The acting is very good. The storytelling is on point.  This type of film suits my tasted really well so I really liked it. I recognize the pacing and complexity of the movie might turn some people off, but I thought it was great.",1
73,Great visualization of the black hole and wormhole. It sounds cliché but I'm still touched by the power of love and persistence.,1
74,(95/100)A very very good Sci-Fi that delivers on its runtime. Everything from the relationship with Murphy to the realism of the science was done perfectly.,1
75,This movie was amazing. It had a great tension throughout the whole movie and it made me feel a lot of different emotions along the journey. The story felt very unique and it told its story in a brilliant way. One of the best movies I’ve seen in a long time!,1
76,I love that concept and i also hope that Christopher_Nolan make some more interesting movies based on Interstellar.. IS he making a new movie like this? https://www.assignmentbox.co.uk,1
77,"The best Sci-fi movie i've see. Great history, perfect OST, and fantastic interpretations",1
78,"I have watched Interstellar so many times I lost count, it is one of my favourite movies, ever. It is thrilling and emotional. And the soundtrack is stunning.",1
79,"Thank God for Christopher Nolan.  It's been so long since I've left a theater with the sense of wonder, awe, and excitement that this movie inspires. Take yourself to the movie, leave the plot point busting and science fact checking for the others, sit back, and enjoy a truly original and emotional experience presented by a genius.",1
80,"What a beautiful, enthralling epic Interstellar is. This was my most anticipated movie of the year and despite other reviews being mixed or mixed to positive I believe this to be one of the best movies of the year! Christopher Nolan has created another masterful film and a movie I will not forget anytime soon.",1
81,Sabia desde un principio que no iba a ser la típica película de ciencia ficción con aliens y explosiones por doquier. Es lo mas parecido al viaje de Kubrick que se ha filmado hasta el momento y esta a ese excelente nivel. Excelentes actuaciones y fotografía. La recomiendo para aquellos fanáticos del genero.,1
82,"This. Is. The. Movie. Of. The. Decade.I was getting a little skeptical about the end, but they pulled it off.Amazing effects, story, characters, everything came together perfect.",1
83,"One of the best films I have ever seen in my life. This movie should be rated a lot higher than the given score it currently has. After watching this film, I can now die happy.",1
84,"Through wormhole to an Exoplanet and falling into a black hole. Epicness at Its best. Nolan did the job again and proved himself. Awesome Story and Plot, direction is best, And the characters are amazing. Best sci fi movie in which everything is explained in so much detail. A must watch!",1
85,This movie show the danger and beauty that awaits us at the same time. Consequences that are inevitable. Written and directed very good - a high level. Emotions border with a very good sense. I suppose that the film gets low ratings from people who do not understand some of the issues of modern science and think that this is fiction - here you are wrong. The film is an artistic vision that humankind will follow having so many misunderstand on Earth ;),1
86,"Interstellar, taking sci-fi by the throat and giving us something we have never seen before and doubtfully ever will again. I followed this movie since I knew it was in production. I have grown to have great confidence in Christopher Nolan and his abilities as a director, and as a writer, not to mention his brother who helped him with this one. Quite ambitious to make a movie about a worm hole, even more so that the human race depends on what is on the other end for survival. My mind was blown, such a large scale with very rich and deep emotion for each character. The grandeur and the detail supersedes anything I've ever seen before.  Just when you think this movie is a little too tame, it flips you over. Isn't as structurally sound as some of his others, but this is flat out incredible. Only the best of the best can take these components and make a movie out of it. And not just a movie, a great movie. Worth a watch.",1
87,"Everything about this movie is of high quality: the acting, story, visuals, music, etc.  By far the best science fiction movie I have ever seen.  A very pleasant surprise out of Hollywood where the normal sci-fi is a bunch of people or aliens running around shooting colored beams at each other.  Interstellar is a tremendous work of art and, as a bonus, a good showing of the consequences of general relativity.",1
88,"One of the best movies of 2014 and one of my personal favorites. The acting was great and Nolan did a great job with the directing and writing. People complain that it was too long, but I never noticed the length because I was so engrossed the entire time. 10/10 would watch it again.",1
89,"Even though the plot of Interstellar is very straight forward I was very delighted as the depiction of the science in the film. Granted the film makers took several liberties to promote good story telling but overall it was done very well. I have read other reviews addressing the middle portion being slow and boring but the producers of the film had to describe what was going on to a very broad general audience. The average person on the street will not ""understand"" what the producers are trying to illustrate for a fairly complex concept. The depiction of gravitation lensing on the black hole was very well done. This film is not typical popcorn fair and it makes you think long after the lights come back on in the theater. There is a lot going on with this film on several levels and was a joy to view.",1
90,pits the best movie I have watched for a while. It makes you think about the future and the universe differently and I walked out of the theater with an entire different prospective on life. Great movie and must watch,1
91,"A fantastic, thought-provoking film with an original story. Not a second in this film is short of thrilling, not to mention the magnificent, operatic score. To top it all off, this film has the aptest and profoundest recitation of ""Do not go gentle into that good night"" by Dylan Thomas--really gripping! I highly recommend this film.",1
92,"Nolan nos da um presente de ficção científica incrível, tanto na sua parte visual como em seu complexo enredo, e também há algumas referências ao clássico 2001 - Uma Odisseia no Espaço. O filme é incrível e vale muito a pena.",1
93,"The movie was amazing! Was disappointed with TDKR, and didn´t have big expectations for Interstellar, but I was totally blown away. The ending was a little bit simple but its still the best movie I have seen in years.",1
94,"Christopher Nolan is GENIUS!! I knew I loved Inception and Batman: The Dark Knight Trilogy, but he has outdone himself with Interstellar. I recommend everyone see this film. Regardless of where you stand on issues such as these, this movie will make you think about the human race and its current trajectory in relationship to how we continue abusing the Earth and its finite resources. Do I think that an apocalyptic event is going to happen soon, I am not sure...only the Lord does. But I do realize that we as humans who continue to pursue life in a ultra over-consumerism manner are headed for some tough times if not already. Overall I think this movie will at least make you wonder what preservation of human life would take and whether we can reverse our destructive thinking.",1
95,"This movie made me cry. I don't cry. The story went on and on and never got boring. I loved watching it, so much suspense. Loved it loved it loved it!!",1
96,"Interstellar is one of those rare movies where I was truly suffering from a case of sensory overload. The science has been, for the most part, back up by scientists. Neil DeGrasse Tyson compliment the movie and he said he enjoyed it greatly. The humor is brief but truly sits with you for awhile and the laughs you have are genuine. From is time on Earth to is time in Space, it's a ride I didn't want to get off. The first planet was the most unique take on a planets ocean system that I've ever seen be done in a movie. Remembering that this planet was near a blackhole with massive gravity only led me more towards the amazing things that were happening on it. The special guest actor was fantastic, and I won't spoil anything, but you have never hated a man and ever felt more for a man in your entire life. The second planet was impressive as well, but we didn't get to experience it as much as we did the first planet. It was still memorable. I plan on seeing this movie many more times before it's out of the theater, I love it that much. This movie gets very emotional at times where the main guy, Coop, must leave his daughter behind. There are two story lines going on, with one being the most focus. Even I, a man that likes to think he doesn't cry often, teared of every time they did. The final scene involving Coop with someone very special, was the most emotional part of the entire movie for me, I thought I was going to break down. 10/10 will see again.",1
97,"I feel this is a masterpiece and one of the best science fiction movies ever made. I was expecting something turgid and nonsensical reading some of the reviews beforehand. I'm so glad they were wrong. How this film didn't score twice as highly as the overrated thrill ride of Gravity I will never know! The plot and subtext of Gravity could be written on a beer mat. Intestellar is weight sci fi tome. An ode to wonder, time and love. Don't listen to the ridiculous berks who slate this film. I can only assume Nolan has reached the point of saturation where it's become fashionable to hate him. This film has it all - the ambition to show other worlds in a way we've never seen before, womholes, massive black holes, mile high tidal waves, dazzlin space vistas, and at the centre amazing performances by all the actors involved, especially McCaugnehey. It's also a film that means something, with a  a complex and deep message about the human instinct for survival, ingenuity and the current threat to our planet. Oh and some of the best onscreen robots since the Star Wars droids. I can understand that some people who know nothing about physics, or who don't want to think and want answers on a plate might not like this film. It's closest to 2001 but in my opinion much better. Don't expect Guardians of the Galaxy. If you like serious sci-fi. philosophical films that will linger with you,  or have ever dreamt of the stars, you must see this film. I'm seeing it again tomorrow.",1
98,"Well directed, great visual effects, and filled with amazing performances, this is a beautiful film with a complex, original plot with your typical Christopher Nolan plot twists. Nonetheless, this is a film that cannot be missed. It's truly one of the best films of 2014.",1
99,What an Amazing Movie! Interstellar is really good and very entertaining.Christopher Nolan is really A good Director from The Dark Knight Trilogy  Then Inception and finally Interstellar.,1
100,"Interstellar. InterSTELLAR.Good but not great movie.Fantastic visuals. Big sound effects. Overblown soundtrack.Acting was fine, but too sentimental.Well executed. But lacked finesse, mystery and elegance.",1
102,"Interstellar is stunning in its scenery and description of outer Space. The storytelling is tight and well written. The last 5 five minutes or så is useless, other than that it is a must see movie especially if you liked Gravity. Nolan is a great director.",1
103,"Very good movie, but not great.  The third act falls off the rails after the first two were telling a great sci-fi story.  The visuals, sound, directing, acting were all top notch however.",1
104,"Mindblowingthis is the future of intellectual cinematalking about real science and overwhelming hope at the end.no matter what kind of belief you support.you would love and follow this ideamy great gratitude toward Nolan",1
105,"Yes, this movie is very long... not for everybody..but trust me, if you like fantasies, you don't wanna miss this one! The acting was not really that great but the story is pretty dramatic al though it had it's cons... Overall i think it was very interesting and i give it a 8/10 because of the amazing visuals and soundtrack!",1
106,"Scientifically accurate, stunning in visuals, it is an impressive feat for Nolan. While the casting is good, I felt that the emotion and crying in the film was distracting, superseding the special effects in the film. But the acting at least was human and natural, though McConaughey needs to slow down with the tears.",1
107,One of the best scifi films made period. Amazing heart wrenching inspiring story/visuals and sountrack. Makes you think about what we should REALLY be aiming for in life. I was crying my eyes out on more than one moment in this masterpiece.,1
108,"More bloated exposition and drawn out yawn-inducing scenes of nothing happening. There's about 45 minutes of film here worth watching. Everything else is forgettable, melodramatic, and full of itself.",0
109,"Inception meets Contact. Pros: Great Emotional Drama. Cons: Terrible Scifi. The movie doesn't make any sense, Nolan should have employed an actual Physicist who specialized in quantum singularity theory. I've seen a steady Decline in Nolan's writing, and perhaps its time for him to step back and direct better screenplays. At this point, he's suffering from Shyamalan Syndrome.",1
110,"I'm speechless, i would love to be able to explain this movie to you but unfortunately i'm not able to.I am a lover of Sci Fi & i had expected a good movie  but what i was subjected to was amazing.You have to see this movie, anyone that gives this movie a mediocre score well you have to feel sorry for them.I just wish all Sci Fi movies were as good as this one.",1
111,"Interstellar....With a movie this big it's hard to review it without making you read tons of text you don't want to, Or giving away plot points that make the movie what it is. So Ill try my best to keep it short and to the point.Interstellar is a 3 hour long Sci-Fi/Action/Drama directed by Christopher Nolan staring Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway. The acting from the main cast was amazing, everyone felt like they had a strong connection. I found this movie extremely imaginative and eye opening, It covers some subjects few to no movies have ever cover before. The base of the story without giving away to much is Earth is unable to produce enough food and Humans are forced to explore for other planets.Even with a run time of 3 hours Nolan does a great job at delivering those emotional gut punches and breath taking scenes that pull you right back in. The run time can feel a bit long and I do feel like Nolan could have shaved off a few minuets. Sadly there was a few plot holes as well, almost like Nolan was piecing it together near the end and makes the last few minutes seem detached from the rest of the film.Those minor gripes aside, Interstellar is a phenomenal film that showcases amazing CGI and practical effects to bring you truly immersive experience. A movie like this is best experienced for yourself and will be even more enjoyable if you can walk into this movie not seeing any trailers. This is one of the best films I've seen in 2014 and will keep me thinking for awhile.",1
112,"Once again, Christopher Nolan delivers. The visual effects are top notch, the performances are very well done, and there is much emotion to be felt throughout the entire film. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who's a fan of space themes movies.",1
113,"Wow! Just wow! I was up, I was down. How engrossing a movie. I am deeply impressed by how much emotion and story they were able to put down in under 3 hours. All the while, I never felt rushed or lost. The what ifs and only ifs make this movie a pleasure to watch. Hats off to everyone involved in its making!",1
116,"Sci Fi fan here, never heard of the director, dont care etc. I watch movies. I really liked Interstellar. If you like a good, real science fiction story, then this is the one to see. If you are a Dad with a daughter or 3 and you like science fiction then you really have to see this. I'm sorry but I have to nerd rant, so a semi spoiler is below................Some scientist can outmatch a former fighter and test pilot really? I mean he's matt daemon, got it - but there is no way a test pilot would have just stood there after some dude rips off his comms transmitter. AND THEN said dude, who is some scientist would no way beat the crap out of a test pilot. That's my only complaint.",1
117,"When the list of best picture nominations came out Interstellar was, unsurprisingly, not among them. Despite an expanded category than now could have 10 nominations to account for big blockbusters like this, one of the best pictures of the year was not among them. Why? Interstellar is a great movie. It is the reason we go to watch movies. It isn't some popcorn flick you go watch to kill time on the weekends, it is a deep, epic space that you want to see opening night and it is that good. It has elements from everything, from the epic special affects and feel of space of Gravity, to a strong and heartfelt love story of a man and his daughter. It missed on some stuff, sure, some of the dialogue wasn't perfect and it wasn't as full of an ending as it could have been, but it did something very movies did nowadays, it aimed huge. It might not have quite measured up to its massive expectations, but it tried and you could feel it in an epic way you'll never get from a marvel movie, or even an Indie. This was a great movie, and this is how big blockbusters should be made. With passion and talent unmatched, Christopher Nolan has made something incredible. A classic.",1
118,"Amazing movie and instant classic. Everything feels real and possible.The only criticism is that I'd like to see some explanation about what happened in the future with the governments and the population in general, but I understand that it wasn't the focus of the movie.Still I give it a 10 out of 10.",1
119,"One of the most amazing visual experiences to date. I guess the performances are good, it's difficult to care because the characters are not very well developed. All the characters are essentially vessels for exposition, nobody really feels real. The plot is overly convoluted, like all Nolan movies. But see it, dude. why not?",1
120,"A great movie. The cosmological and the human are mixed together in one long beautiful hopeful hymn to human being. The love in this movie felt genuine, not a mere Hollywood ingredient. Normally a movie about escaping the Earth that we have destroyed would make me sigh at the unrealism of such a vision, but that difficulty was acknowledged gracefully before the movie soared off into its exuberant flight. As in life, nothing is one dimensional, nothing is simply distant or simply close, nothing is done and dealt with. The ""bad guy"" is just a regular flawed man who unwittingly helps more than he ever could by being a good guy; love animates the characters' actions even when it is twisted. This is a deep and deeply moving movie that carries itself with great grace. Where it has to borrow it does so respectfully; where it has to bend realism it does so with narrative elegance and an eye on the deeper things. I'd say it's of the best science fiction movies there is.",1
121,"Absorbed, deafened and depressed. I suspect that I won't be buying the DVD, unlike Inception, which I wanted to watch over again. Whatever the science might have been saying - and you might need to have read (and understood) Hawking, the emotions were loud and clear and Zimmer-insistent. Still, it did make me want to go home and hug my sons.",1
122,"This movie was absolutely amazing and overwhelming visually. Many of the scenes were straight out of a fantastical dream/nightmare. I was simultaneously disturbed and enthralled by the entire thing. The simplicity of the early scenes made the movie that much better because you could feel that some serious stuff was going to happen later on and Christopher Nolan was just teasing you with some early run of the mill exposition. That being said, the story line was pretty horrendous. The movie was 3 hours long, but it  felt unbelievably rushed. An epic story like this should have been a ten hour affair, seriously. It needs that much time in order to develop properly since the scale is so large and the story so dense. The transition between the exposition and the rising action was particularly awful. The way they present the 'premise' of the mission was down right bad. The movie just didn't flow like it should have, and there were lots of mistakes in the script. Some of the dialogue between the astronauts is also really terrible. They speak in astronomy buzz words that excited teenagers might use in a intro to space high school class. But despite the story, Its an amazing movie which deserves to be watched many times in order to experience the sheer awe of the special effects. But beware, because the special effects are actually pretty frightening at points!",1
123,"Pretty good. Though to be fair, it should also be noted that it is too long, too noisy, and there are gaping plot holes. But so what? This is about an emotional and redemptive journey spanning the stars and the generations, not realism. After three hours, you really end up feeling like you have been on a journey yourself. Great performances throughout - though better diction by the actors would not have hurt. But whichever way you cut it, this is a serious movie, portraying humanity facing adversity in ways that are both moving and artistic. Considerably better than any of the Batman movies.  And it gets an extra mark for the special effects - which thankfully, do not overwhelm the movie. Somehow they simultaneously become both achingly beautiful, and austere at the same time - which is a major achievement in today's over-done blockbusters.",1
124,"The storm of love and hate Interstellar has gotten since its release, and the hype it generated before it tells more about the stubborn fanbase Nolan has than his films.  Interstellar, although far from the comparisons with 2001: A Space Odyssey, shares with the Kubrick movie the feeling that the story is not really about space. People have complained about plot holes. There are some, pretty clearly, and a physicist would tell you those plot holes make the movie completely unbelievable, but some of the theories presented in Interstellar have no reason not to be possible. Anyway, this is not Discovery Channel, so we should just enjoy what we see and not dig much further away from the screen. Matthew McConaughey really has hit a positive streak this last couple of years, and his acting here is perfectly on pitch, together with Jessica Chastain's. Unfortunately I can't say the same for Anne Hathaway, or Matt Damon. Or Wes Bentley. The effects have some weird flaws that only appear sometimes during the movie, in certain scenes - the CGI there looks from 20 years ago, but then goes back to modern-looking in the next scene. The cinematography is not spectacular like it could have been, especially since the majority of the movie takes place either inside the spaceship or on Earth, so that wouldn't have been so expensive to achieve. All in all, a very interesting plot (if you forget about the actual science) and an excellent performance by McConaughey, but on the technical side it falls a bit short. And by the way, I cannot understand for the world why the Oscars snub this while last year Gravity (a much dimmer, more ridiculous, and essentially uglier movie) managed to win 7. Maybe Nolan doesn't deserve Best Director, and Interstellar doesn't deserve Best Picture, but this movie is light years ahead of Gravity - pun intended.",1
125,"The First time I could not perceive the movie...So I went for the second time...Then I liked it very much that I wanted to see it again, especially for Hans' Score...I watched it twice after...Each times the movie gave different insights, be it in the level of science, emotion, religion or the film making...But after all these watches,there is at least a little part i couldn't consume or comprehend...Then I came to a conclusion that Interstellar is religious enough that I couldn't understand what I can't perceive in it...",1
126,"While not Christopher Nolan's best movie, its ambition is refreshing to see in today's age.  Most of the performances where great, I expect nothing less from Matthew McConaughey but there is one actor/actress who does disappoint.  A bit of a spoiler so I won't say who it was.  The story was good enough to keep me entertained.  Just like Inception, this is a movie you will need to watch more than once.  Too be fair Inception is a much better movie.  Interstellar is a mediocre Nolan movie. Mediocre is harsh, but a mediocre Nolan is light-years (pun intended) beyond most other movies.  There isn't another director out there that makes me as excited to see a movie as Nolan.  Enjoy the ride, we have to wait 2 more years for another Nolan movie.",1
127,"I got to say, this movie is very beautiful and well made. But if you are expecting a sci-fi movie you will be a little disappointed, I was at least. The space travel and visiting of other planets is secondary unfortunately, while the human relations between the characters is the primary plot of the movie. Every time you get excited about the physics and quantum mechanics in the movie, its pushed in the background. Its a little hard to describe without spoiling anything, but all i can say is, don't expect a sci-fi movie, expect something else and be surprised by the space you get to see. As a side note, if this was Nolan's vision about how other plants could look like, i really hope he is wrong..",1
128,"Interstellar is Christophers Nolans latest movie, and it doesn't disappoint. Following from his previous film 'The Dark Knight Rises', Nolans latest project is about finding another planet and galaxy that can sustain life, as earth is dying. I believed it needed more detail on why/how the earth is dying, it gives you some information, but not enough to be justifiable for me personally. The plot and dialog is interesting, with some great moments, but i reckon dragged on a bit too long than it needed to be. The plot is also rather complex than it needed to be, with it being difficult to follow at times, but it did have a lot of interesting ideas. Matthew MoConaughey had an absolute great performance, with also some great acting from Anna Hathaway and Mackenzie Foy. This is a ambitious project, and while Nolan did have a lot of great ideas and did really well with the movie, the execution of it wasn't perfect, the ideas were there but struggled to put it on the big screen. Overall this is another fantastic Christopher Nolan and a must watch.",1
129,"it was good but I didn’t think it was great.  I think that was more down to its hype than it is it’s actual quality.  I believed I was getting a game changing movie done by one of the biggest directors in Hollywood, when in reality you are just getting a very decent Sci Fi film, and I think if it had been marketed that way maybe we might have enjoyed it more than we actually did.That’s not to say Interstellar is a bad film, oh god no, for the amount you pay to go and get a cinema ticket you could do a lot worse right now. It's mainly suffers due to a few of the usual Nolan tropes and some fairly big plot holes and story elements that aren’t explained too well and the fact that several shots look like they were ripped directly from 2001 a space odyssey",1
130,"This is a new '10 Point Scale' rating system based on 10 important aspects of a film which is crucial for a fair assessment. It's a structured way to rate films rather than just randomly putting in a number. And, the first film to be rated on this is the film 'Interstellar' which gets an overall rating 7/10 according to the format. 1) Direction: 6/10 Direction is all about having control over your audience i.e. the control to guide them to your vision. It’s a summation of the essential skillsets to engage and disengage your viewers. The success of a film is totally dependent on how a director exerts control. In Interstellar, it seems to be in control in parts but every now and then things go out of hand. There are some great build ups and every time we expect it to blossom into something it falls flat on its face. Some of the B-plots which starts to build up nicely are just left unattended at the end. The plot involving Cooper’s son and his family is a glaring example of the same and if it’s not so important they why build it up in the first case. There isn’t even a note of conclusion or ambiguity in there. At the end, Nolan seems to have taken the easy way out by making his audience happy with an end they’re satisfied with. But isn’t it going against the whole idea of control when you let your audience decide the outcome rather than you doing it as the director? 2) Philosophy/Vision/Idea/Subtext/Metaphors/Easter Eggs: 4/10 Okay, we get it ‘love is beyond time or dimension’. But is there any way you can make it a little more subtle? And, if you call this an idea or a philosophy then how is it different to millions of other films about love? Mr. Nolan you need to think more rather than just quote lines from Dylan Thomas poetry book for an intellectual effect. 3) Does it move you emotionally? 9/10 Yes it moves you emotionally and it has been done well. Christopher Nolan has successfully upped the emotional stakes in this film. There was a backlash in Inception for low emotional stake and he’s definitely worked on this. It shows in the film. These scenes are intense whether it’s nail biting action or a sad scene which chokes your throat. 4) Unity: 6/10 By unity it means if the film is uniform with recurring motifs and parallelism, or not. Interstellar, unfortunately is low on a uniform experience scale even though there are some recurring themes of love. But it’s not consistent enough in action because Nolan brings in some heavy handed scientific theories to stitch it and nobody gets it. 5) Is it Poetic (Realistic/Formative)? 5/10 Adding a line from one of the greatest poets doesn’t necessarily make the film poetic. Poetry is derived from the experience of the film combined with the ideas and philosophy hidden as a subtext. So, is this a space film about love just to show that love’s beyond time and space? Seriously! Mr. Nolan, getting it scientifically correct doesn’t mean that it’s realistic enough, forget it being poetic. 6) Screenplay/Writing: 4/10 It is perhaps the worst screenplay by the Nolans. First, character motivations are plain stupid for most for e.g. nobody knows what Cooper’s son or Dr. Mann are motivated by and why do they act in a negative way. By ‘nobody knows’ it don’t mean that facts weren’t mentioned in the film; rather it’s a thing about developing characters where it never picks up. You don’t relate to the characters, especially Dr. Mann. Secondly, the plots are all over the place and it adds to confusion rather than creating a unified experience. Also, it’s clear that Nolan tried his best to avoid an ending in disunity and in the process rips this film of its credibility or thought. Plot twists don’t come out organically and it seems forced. Some of the dialogues are decent involving the computer but rest remains pedestrian. 7) Acting: 9/10 Acting is great in this film and it helps create those intense scenes. Mcconaughey's good but not sure if it’s an Oscar winning performance. 8) Editing: 9/10 Editing is slick and it helps create those moments you’ll remember this film for. The parallel action of the rotating space craft with the drama in earth is worth noting. It had the audience holding on to their seats tight. Also, the pace slows down very effectively to heighten the emotional scenes. 9) Cinematography: 9/10 Cinematography is great and almost everyone loved the use of different aspect ratios for different scenes; not sure what purpose was?. The overall cinematography is great and it does give you the feel of 2001 experience at times. 10) Sound: 9/10 Great sound always helps in creating a great experience. The dialogue, sound effects were spot on and music in Nolan films is always great. To conclude, this film is a great effort but it required that little bit of ‘thought’ and ‘time’ to grow in the writing stage but it comes out underdeveloped much like Caesarian.",1
131,"There is so much science in this film without sacrificing the emotional aspect a movie should have. It brings you to their world where you'll feel the excitement being outside the earth as well as the boredom of staying in a shuttle for years. It was believable until the dimensional theories kind of stuffs mixed up towards the ending. There were so many conflicts that made the twists not surprising at all. If only the film made a direct and simple plot, it could have been better than Gravity.",1
132,"Fairly engaging trip into a twisting science fiction world.  It helps to have seen other Christopher Nolan films.Has a few eye rolling lapses in logic.  (Doesn't beer need wheat and barley?)That said it still offers much more to think about than an average popcorn movie.",1
133,"Interstellar should be praised on its visual and technical achievement.Interstellar is a feast for the senses, the sound and visual design is amazing.Interstellar's pacing is less inpresive, it takes a while for it to get into the meat of the story.",1
134,"Interstellar was a damn good sci-fi movie.  A 3 hour movie that was so entertaining, it felt like 2 hours. The sound work and visuals in this were outstanding and I actually for once enjoyed Matthew McConaughey's character. Its worth the watch in theatres just for the visuals and sound alone.",1
135,"Interstellar is considered one of the best science fiction movies even if it's not that good for many people and i am one of them .i am going to try to illustrate and criticize what i didn't like about the movie and how it could be better .Most of people who didn't like the movie because they really didn't understand it and what happens  through the movie ,it needed some how some more illustrations for why would this happening since most of the people are unfamiliar  with modern physics and this film depended a lot on so many physical concepts like special and general relativity and the singularity and the worm hole concept and the string theory and a lot of quantum physics .But actually those who are familiar with physics also didn't find it very good like me.first of all most of the physics in the film are made in the 20th century and this movie is supposed to be in the future and they still don't depend on any of what was discovered even in the 21th century nothing that was really new , but it has it's advantages as not to make some wrong viewing for it so it was OK, the second thing is that most of what happened in the movie is a very well known examples for special relativity so most of those who read about it before know what will happen very well in every situation they are going to do, so it loses its complexity and weirdness .which make it a very boring movie it will be like watching a documentary about special relativity.So now let's go for the explanation of the movie the movie's story is very simple actually but Nolan combined it with other complex and unfamiliar concepts for people.In the beginning of the movie  they were showing how the earth in the future became a horrible place that no one will be able to live in it and scientists lost hope in earth so they are trying to find another planet to leave on and that's was by finding the air plane which was hacked by Matthew McConaughey to get the information of the astronauts  who were sent to find a new home on other planet and they will never come back, and after that they find information in  to murphy's room which was done by gravity to give them the code to find the space center and here's some how there is some contradictions in the following event that after the space center offering him to go as a pilot and then there was a message sent to tell him to  stay and not to go( i will explain why there's a contradiction at the end).first there were some message sent for them to tell them that there is a life on one of the planets by another crew so they went there the only unclear part until this moment was the wormhole part and why it's like that and it was explained in the movie but in incorrect way that they said it's in 3D while the space is in 2D i don't know how even they said this, of course this is theoretical concept only and it's not proved y et but it's okay actually the space is in 3D but since it's very wide we consider it as 2D space but in the worm hole the space takes some sort of cylindrical shape which make you see the space very near to you that seems to be 3D of space as they said since the space is like a ball so it's like a cylinder that connects the two ends for the ball.then when they went for the planets where there's huge wave actually i don't know how they didn't know about this with all of the technology they are having it's clear that as the gravity increases the tides will increase and the gravity increases since they are near to a black hole which have a very high gravity tends to infinity and due to this the high tides of water waves happen on this planet and here comes Einstein's special relativity to take place and it's considered to be the most important physical concept in this movie it's about time dilation actually and how the time changes from system to system according to their speed relative to the speed of light so as the system goes faster the time began to go slower in this system that's why when they were back to the ship they found their partner older by so many years.I think that the rest of the film until before he goes in the black hole is understandable .actually at the part of the black holes a lot of people were fooled to think that this is actually what McConaughey saw in the black hole of course not since when he is in the black hole he moves in a very high speed equals to or may be greater than the speed of light so of course he won't be able to see any since he is moving with the speed of light so how he will see any thing it's just a view of what around him not the light actually.After going through the black hole there is nothing to deal with science at all, all of this was Nolan's imagination to go in the fifth dimension OK we can say that if you exceeded the speed of light you will be in the fifth dimension and you will see the other four dimensions and control them of course you will see every single moment in time as a picture not a video because the time has no effect",1
136,"The story was very good, it reminded me of the classic sci-fi novels where time-dilation is used as plot driver. I had to subtract some points for the soundtrack though. It literally drove me out of the theatre about 3 quarters through the movie.",1
137,"This movie has a very intriguing plot, some great acting, and absolutely magnificent visuals. However, it's the pacing that bogs the movie experience down from greatness. But still, it's a solid movie that's worth seeing. Just expect to be confused.",1
138,"Two-thirds of a great imaginative sci-fi movie which buckles under it's own weight in a disappointing clumsy 3rd act. Still, there's enough fascinating sci-fi elements to warrant a thumbs up. I was ready to love it, but it lost steam at the finish line, similar to Speilberg's mixed bag of ""A.I'",1
139,Great movie. My favorite. People that don't like this are just too simple minded. Go back to school and learn astrophysics. This is a powerful movie. The metacritic critics have no brains by giving interstellar a 74,1
144,"This is a very well received movie, keeping the top of Sci-Fi genre for 2014. Actually this amazes me since it’s not such an easily digestible movie. You can feel your mind heavy after it, full of thoughts, ideas like after a “spiritual workout”. Well documented facts about space, black holes, and possibilities about different dimensions are blended in with the struggles of the normal human limitations. I loved the acting and the cast. The special effects were really impressive. I recommend this movie in a nice setting, when you have at least some hour’s free time - with nothing major on your mind – best for weekend. You will find out why.",1
148,"Interstellar will remain in the top of cinema's history, alongside Inception, Matrix, Mr.Nobody, The Fountain, Lotr and so on. Breathtaking! Without absolute no doubt, it's the best work of art by Christopher Nolan. And like someone else say 'The story felt very unique', totally. Maybe it's a little bit too scientifically and after the first viewing there is a lot of confusion, but it's flawless and brilliant and deserves unconditionally 10/10!",1
149,"Movie's score/soundtrack is wayyy too loud for this movie, the director should have made a decision to edit this but no.. this entire movie should stop distribution, have the sound track more leveled and turned down about 7-18% and recut. Terrible score in this movie.. movie plot thought is great just taken away by the insanely loud music",0
151,Nolan did it again !!! Through this masterpiece cinema and his vision we got a glimpse of near future interstellar travel and experienced the power of love and need for sacrifice that mankind has to make to survive its own extinction.Truly it was an amazing mind-bending and thought provoking experience.,1
152,"I went to a long journey last night. I visited several faraway and uncanny places which most of people can’t even have imagination of them. I put my steps on the grounds which the mankind never touch them before. In confrontation of such a huge bulk of love, greatness and wisdom I was feeling tiny and helpless. I got lost desperately in different dimensions of time and space so that I forgot to breath. I got closer to God and I met my own spirit. I saw Interstellar last night….",1
153,"I've been waiting for Interstellar for 1,5 years and today i've watched it. I won't say about its plot or music or cast or director's work. But it is a masterpiece, sure, the masterpiece that could be shot only by Christopher Nolan. Thank you for this movie, Chris. Now, i need to think about all.",1
154,"Nolan did add another one of the masterpiece to Sci-fi coomunity again. Scientific accuracy for visualization of black hole and wormhole is undoubtedly realistic since there is an astrophysicist working as film assistant. Hard science had been poured into the film so much that it is hard for normal audience to really 100% understand the scientific theory behind the plot. Some of them were hiding in just few words like Quantum entanglement that the robot try to use to establish communication between inside and out side of the black hole.To summarize, this film really catch my eyes at first glance and finally grab my heart at last.",1
155,"This is for me the best movie of 2014 so far!, I really enjoyed it and i love it. i really recommend it. i don't want to spoil anything, but i just want to express myself about what i love of this movie and i love everything!",1
156,"GRIPPING SCI FI MOVIE WITH TECHNOLOGY AND STUFF !! Yes, the movie is almost 3 hours long, and by the end of the movie you are glad it was and you actually wish there was more. In addition to the amazing visuals and the compelling story there are a few nice twists and turns throughout the movie that have you gripping your seat. Matthew McConaughey does an amazing job of carrying the movie as the lead, his performance is exceptional. Amazing acting, and a few tear jerking moments...very convincing stuff McChonaughey pulls off the loving father and astronaut with ease. Much better then umm ""cof gravity"". Highly recommend watching in IMAX 70mm version to create the full immersion experience. So, the story moves along at a good pace and keeps the audience glued to the screen, at the end of our screening there was almost a full standing ovation when the movie finished in a packed theater. Applause, applause and more applause . . . alright, alright, alright !!",1
157,"Great movie, great story, superb acting and overall a must-see.Story followed a different path than most other sci-fi movies. Original story is a welcome feature.See it in IMAX - it's worth it for the visuals.I'll probably see this 2 or 3 times before it leaves theaters. Nolan does it again!Reminded me of a cross between Gravity, 2001: A Space Odyssey  (space peril and action sequences), Inception (twists and levels), and 12 Monkeys (a bit of time-travel).In summary, see if you like sci-fi, see if you like Nolan's other films, see if you like original stories and space epics. Go see it man, it was great!",1
158,"What an Incredible and Emotional film. INTERSTELLAR paints a beautiful picture of humanity while striving to be even more. Led by incredible performances from McConaughey and Chastain in particular, and complemented by the incredible writing and direction, INTERSTELLAR stands out as the best of the year. (so far)",1
159,"Wow! Just wow! Uhhhmaazing!! Left the theater feeling awed and mind blown by this incredible journey that Christopher Nolan took my head trip on! The feelings and emotions i felt in this film were grand!! What a ride!! Acting, cinematography, score, sound editing, and directing was top notch! I immediately placed this film in my top 10 of all time just after finishing my first viewing. It was that good! But just like a lot of the critics... I too started thinking about all the plot holes and how all this could of really let up to its mind bending conclusion. I too was thinking... This was so close to being Nolan's masterpiece... If it wasn't for such a convuloted plot! But while watching the movie, i just accepted everything in the moment because Nolan filmed the pacing beatifully and everything seemed to flow just right. I was never bored during this 3 hour movie... Every scene was engaging from minute to end. That being said... I still did have those questions to potential plot holes in the film. But even despite those flaws the movie was that amazing! I know a film is even better for myself when i start questioning and thinking about the movie hours after i get home... And wanting to immediately watch it again a 2nd time to piece together anything that i may have missed. I believe the last movie that absorbed my thoughts that deeply after viewing was inception... AndWaduyuhknow.. Another nolan epic. Now i did have to go on google to learn more about quantum mechanics, gravity/relativity, 4th and 5th dimensions, wormholes/blackholes... Because my knowledge was pretty limited in those fields prior to watching this film. And i do know that quantum physics and all the theories are exactly what they are... Theories. But the more i delve into this research, the more plausible this theory sounds backed upon scientific facts. Now, even though researching all those topics, i still had those questions in the plot that still didnt make 100% sense to me and i feel what a lot of critics felt... That the movie was grand and epic even despite its flaws in the plot... So I tried to find my own interpretations to the plot holes. But with only 1 viewing and so much information given throughtout the movie, it was frustrating and I wished i could just go and watch it again a 2nd time. But impatiently so.. i ended up finding a discussion forum on interstellar... Anndd ooh dammnn... After reading that discussion thread with everybodies different interpretations opened my eyes so much more to this movie. Now when i watch it a 2nd time im convinced everything will fall into pieces perfectly based on all the different interpretations that others have received from the movie. And thats exactly what makes Nolan stand apart from the other great directors like scorcese, spielberg, cameron, howard, etc... All these other directors are amazing because they weave the plot so tightly that you understand the movie in one sitting for the most part. But Nolan, oooh man... With memento, inception, the dark knoght trilogy(moreso memento and inception)... Really makes you think and glue together the missing pieces in the plot to your own interpretation, and will require at least 2 or more viewings to understand it all soundly.. and when you do... The movie becomes more personal for yourself and that much more grand and epic! Now having said that... And after a night of digging and exploring the movie, themes, different interpretations, and field of quantum mechanics... This may very well be Nolan's masterpiece. Right up there with memento and the dark knight. But to me.. the themes that interstellar touches... Have spoken to me the most out of his other two masterpieces. My initial reaction immediately after watching interstellar vaulted the movie into my top 10 of all time just from its sheer scope, brilliant acting, and pacing. But after a night of exploring deeper, this may very well be the best... And im sure after my 2nd viewing... It just may be... The greatest of all time. Christopher Nolan's Masterpiece!",1
160,"The best thing about Interstellar is that, like Inception, the science and the ideas are as real, as sophisticated, and as advanced, as any ideas out there. If you see a critic or somebody saying this is convoluted or overly complex that says more about their lack of understanding than about the movie.",1
161,"Interstellar is visually one of the best movies ever.Its enthralling,intriguing and entertaining for the first half and then in the second half the movie loses its charm.It was still entertaining but I wasnt as pleased as I was for the first hour and 30 min mainly because of some narrative problems.The finale was the most WTF-ish one I've ever seen but it wasnt as rewarding as I expected or wanted it to be.It was ridiculous.Some may argue with me one this one.I get it.Chris Nolan tried to transcend the science and wanted to reach for a mind-blowing ending but when you think about what happens after Cooper's choice thats what makes it ludicrous.This is the reason I give this movie a 8/10 rating.It was fun,charming (even though not for its entire length),entertaining and really really beautiful but the climax is absurd and not rewarding.",1
162,"What I like about Interstellar is that while it has your classic sciency space travel elements, unlike other space-themed movies it does not put this element at its center. It's core rather, is something much deeper - a story of a father and his daughter and their struggles of being apart. Space just happens to be one of the perfect themes for this idea and as a result, the movie is told well. I highly recommend it, as it is in no way ""just another space movie"".",1
163,"Nolan dares what many directors and screenwriters are scared to do these days: make you think. To me, that's a very good thing. His movies have repeatedly been original (which, among all the remakes, sequels, and reimaginings that are so prevalent now-a-days, is unfortunately quite rare) and Interstellar is no exception. It's a very unique film that touches on a subject that has somehow rarely been touched upon. Namely, the intricacies of how worm holes and time travel truly might work and how the human race might utilize them to aid in its survival. This movie doesn't need to rely on flashy special effects (though they are quite good). It doesn't need to fill each moment with action in order to tell a story (I'm looking at you Michael Bay). And it doesn't insult the intelligence of the audience by providing too much detailed explanations from the characters as to how worm holes and time travel work. There are a few scenes where they touch on the subjects, but Nolan assumes that his audience is at least reasonably intelligent and can not only understand the concepts by direct monologue, but also from inference by what's being portrayed on screen. There are moments which someone who is nit-picky might find to be far fetched, but this movie isn't targeted for such an audience. It's targeted towards those who can reasonable suspend their disbelief enough to catch the point the movie is trying to portray. In fact, the movie is less about the science and the theory, but more about the characters and that ""what-if"" factor. The acting is simply superb. I found my manly self holding back tears in one scene, and giggling like a fool in another. To this date, I have yet to watch a movie which Nolan has put out which has been anything but fantastic. He has built a reputation of one of the greatest Directors and screen-writers of our generation, and I'm personally glad to be alive to experience it.",1
164,"Visually stunning, amazingly acted and thought provoking. It is thrilling, but flawed. The last 20 minutes is very convoluted, BUT, Interstellar's greatness, far outweighs it's faults. Interstellar is one of my fave movies of the year! 910.",1
165,"Interstellar is an intriguing tale because of its human characters.  It's a story of a family  who want to do what they love with who they love but are torn apart by a small competing priority - saving humankind. The science fiction theories I struggled with in the credibility department, certain convenient one in a trillion coincidences detracted from the ingenuity and risk of gambles the crew take. For the me most gripping aspects of Interstellar are the breathtaking foreign planet scenes and relationship between McConaughey and his daughter.  The scenes on board the interstellar station are very reminiscent of Alien and the AI robot puts a news spin on HAL from 2001.  The Matt Damon scenes are straight out bizarre! Nolan is always guaranteed to leave you thinking, wondering and conjecturing with friends.  I see other reviewers compare this to Gravity and for what it's worth - I thought Gravity was a far more riveting and thrilling tale.",1
166,"while Ann Hathaway and Mathew Mcconaughey were very weird choices considering neither has really shown the chops for sci-fi, they do put on quite a show.the movie, like an actual space launch, starts of slow, but once they get through the wormhole the movie pretty much is non-stop until it jumps the shark at the end with the whole 5d existing in 3d with time distortions (this movie is not for the scientific faint of heart)it takes a few minutes of watching, but just replace Hal 900 with Michal Caine and Matt Damon and you pretty much got 2001: a space odyssey, so i pretty much give it the same score as 2001 would get.",1
167,"Christopher Nolan has once again proved that he is one of the most important filmmakers of his generation. Interstellar is not just another space flick with impressive visuals. It tackles the most important issue we are currently facing on our planet, namely our very survival in the face of overpopulation and unsustainable living, and the crucial need to overcome our natural instincts in order to evolve as a species. The fact that movie critics and the audience will compare Interstellar with Stanley Kubrick’s masterpiece is a testament to the epic scope of the film. However, Nolan’s latest creation is less surreal and more focused on the future of mankind. Rather than abstractly dealing with our origins and place in the universe and assuming that Earth will be our base for reaching to the stars, Interstellar deals with the harsh realities of an increasingly hostile planet, our short-sighted way of life, our natural instinct of individual survival and how it now poses a threat to our survival as a species and, not least of all, the very unromantic, brutal nature of space travel and relativity. At the same time, unlike 2001, it is not a purely intellectual film. It does not distance itself from human emotion, attempting to strike a balance between its grand scope and the feelings and failings of its characters. Whether it succeeds or not in this balancing act is something people will disagree upon, and it is probably the element that will make or break the film for you. As far as I am concerned, Nolan’s Interstellar is a triumph against the seemingly impossible odds which he faced in this undertaking.",1
168,"Even it accepts many things from former SF. it still inspiring, astonishing and entertaining. It deserve to be the movie of 2014 and the milestong of SF history.",1
169,This movie is one of the best trips ive ever taken in a movie. Its so amazing in every aspect.  The movie is long but seemed not long at ALL. This is a must see in theaters,1
170,"Фильм просто великолепен! Недавно вернулся из кинотеатра - это шедевр однозначно, 10 из 10. Несмотря на почти 3 часа времени не было ни одной скучной минуты. Очень порадовал Мет Деймон который неожиданно появился. Также нельзя не отметить великолепную музыку - она очень хорошо передает настроение фильма. Рекомендовано к просмотру на 100%!",1
171,Thanks Nolan for giving a movie which will make you feel and keeps you puzzled in an Enchanted way.How much ever the critic or the people may criticize but one thing  that everybody should understand that this movie has contributed a lot of things abut space and would have definitely ignited many minds all over the world,1
172,"Interstellar is a movie that attempts to hark back to the pre-CGI days of Sci-fi movies - 2001: A space odyssey, Bladerunner, Alien - and it feels all the more 'real' and visceral for it. Indeed it is probably one of the most visually stunning movies since those aforementioned movies, if not surpassing them in several scenes. Perhaps, strangely, what I appreciated most in Christopher Nolan's efforts was a movie mostly devoid of exaggerated suspense, cheap scares, and throw-away once-liners that fade from memory almost as soon as theyy are uttered. It was a mature portrayal of humanity, and a chilling warning of where we might be headed. Perhaps the only real weakness is in some of the plot mechanics early on. There are some moments that are jarringly unrealistic, from the apparent lack of detailed planning for the mission, a mission of unimaginable importance, to Cooper's seeming complete lack of knowledge of Quantum mechanics (something surely he would have been briefed on prior to launch). I do however concede he needed to inform the audience of some of the science behind their decision-making. What the movie does exceptionally well, is attempt to marry an awe-inspiring journey into the furthest reaches of scientific knowledge with a commentary on human nature and emotional connections. Family, the reason for existence, the nature of the cosmos - all are concepts touched on, at times quite beautifully, in this motion picture. The acting is great. Matthew McConaughey is a stand-out and pretty much carries the emotional component of the film single-handedly. I felt tempted to give it a 10, to counter the usual silly 0s that people often give films they feel disappointed in. It's epic. Certainly on of the greatest Sci-fi movies ever made. It's in my top 10 that's for sure. But then, there haven't really been that many EPIC sci-fi movies ever made. The movie does have its issues, and its not perfect. But I feel sure that it will live long in the memory, as all true classics so often do.",1
173,like michio kaku says if hawking books ideas importing this is the best realistic space journey movie. not like wtf 2001 style and not like just pointles action gravity style. its not 10 becuse some parts just carbon copy of inception.,1
174,"One of the hokiest pieces of sci-fi crud I have ever seen. It is sort of a mash between Gravity, Star Trek and The Matrix except that these movies had more credulity. If you think that love is one of the basic dimensions of the universe along with space and time, you'll probably love the movie. If not, give this show a miss as you'll puke at all the sentimentalism. Regarding the acting, Matthew McConaughey is awful as an astronaut with a southern drawl, and appearing in this movie hasn't helped Jessica Chastain's and Anne Hathaway's career any. They should have known better.",0
175,"Interstellar might not be Nolan's best film but the sheer brilliance of what he made should not be underestimated. Known for his deep thinking and outside the box ideas, Interstellar might be the deepest one yet. Magnificent visuals coupled with a terrific score make for the best film of 2014.",1
180,"Once again, Christopher Nolan has explored an ambitious idea and presented a well-constructed movie. Interstellar can let us submerge ourselves into a space journey, also it reminds us that watching a film is a unique way to explore our imagination. With more half baked comic book movies emerges, Interstellar is a precious gift from Christopher Nolan, it allows us to have an introspection of how we treat the movie industry instead of just entertaining.",1
183,"The Best Movie of the Year, clever story, good casting, perfect visual effects. No more words. Everybody, who likes good & clever stories, must watch this movie.",1
184,"Nolan has done it again. While the critics were saying that Interstellar is too sentimental, they actually got the wrong idea. Nolan may be emulating Kubrick's attention to detail here, but he is essentially making a Spielberg film. That sense of awe: check. Gooey sentimentality: check.  I can't say anymore of the plot, but suffice to say: the visuals are breathtaking, the acting stupendous.  It's not perfect: the dialogue is filled with a lot of exposition. But heck, still one of the best film of 2014. Bring your tissues folks. It's a tearjerker.",1
185,"Interstellar is a full experimental work of dazzling visual and thematic ambition. An epic futuristic adventure driven by pain, fear and regret. Nolan gives us a magnificent, dark, romantic, ambitious and risky clever piece. It is huge and covers not enough to see it once. Nolan takes us to the edge of the universe but reflecting on everything that makes us human. An intense space opera that dazzles and thrills. Nolan has done it again.",1
186,"If you thought prometheus was intelligent, engaging and credible, this is the bore fest movie for you.If you understood everything Bane honked through the cheesgrater on his face in the last batman, this is the mishmash mess for you.If you think superman really exists, and that we should be grateful for such thought provoking super science as his allergy to kypton, this is the 'science' movie for you.If you never, ever, wonder why characters do utterly ridiculous things in movies and feel annoyed at incomprehensible plots, buy a ticket today.if you don't feel a bit annoyed at a director deliberately mixing music and dialogue so NO ONE can hear what is being said, buy the t shirt.If you have any kind of independent cognitive processes, and don't blindly follow the critics, really, honestly, skip it until it comes out onlne/disc and you can skip past the most boring bits.",0
187,"This was an excellent film with huge ideas and a lot of heart - it is definitely a must see. The acting is phenomenal and the story is gripping and incredibly interesting. The effects were amazing as everybody was expecting. It will definitely be divisive but I applaud Nolan for the originality and gall of the film. In a time where we have ~29 superhero movies planned to release in the next 6 years, we need more visionary people pushing the limits and giving us original screenplays and fresh ideas that not only entertain, but stimulate critical thinking. This is exactly what interstellar did, for me at least. Not once did I find myself bored, I felt as though I actually experienced the journey with the characters and could even share their emotions from time to time. This is what movies are about for me. As I watched, I forgot about my own troubles and cares and embarked on an incredible journey with an amazing cast and a story that causes you to wonder what the future has in store for us, and what really is potentially out there in our infinite universe. Interstellar is not without flaws, but it is definitely a movie that deserves to be seen and contemplated. The score by Hans Zimmer is amazing and truly adds to the experience. Don't rely on other people's opinions or form an opinion based on others thoughts before seeing it. Just go see it, and enjoy the bold and spectacular journey it is!",1
188,"I havn't been this blown away by a movie since The Dark Knight Rises, the prvious film by master Christopher Nolan.  I must say I was a little concerned after seeing the mixed reviews, but I did not need to be.  This movie is absolutely fantastic.  I heard criticism that it's too confusing and won't be accessable to a wider audience.  I'm certainly no genius and I was never confused by the science talk.  If I was to criticize the film I will say that it is does get a bit convoluted, and if it ended about ten minutes earlier it would of flowed a little more.  That's all the negatives.  This film is absolutely stunning, unique, original, mesmerizing, and absolutely awe-inspiring.  This film will absolutely go down along side 2001 and Blade Runner as one of the great science fiction films.  Oh and Tars and Case are freaking awesome.  Not to spoil anything but there are sequences in this film that rival the Stargate sequence in 2001 as some of the greatest scenes in science fiction, if not film in general.",1
189,This is the worst movie I have ever seen.  I understand relativity thank you very much.  If you think this movie is based on real science you don't understand it.  But forgetting the science this was still s horrible movie.  It could have been half as long and still would have been crap.  Two hours in I was hoping the human race would expire because it had produced this garbage.,0
191,"As a physicist I have to say this movie is really nicely done. While in many science fiction movies I get easily annoyed about the scientific inveteracies and just plainly wrong depictions of physics, in this movie I was entirely satisfied. I read somewhere that the director of the movie had a real scientist advise him on many matters of the story and filming and they even used real formulas to calculate some of the special effects and visuals in the movie (the black hole sphere for example). The story of the movie is maybe not everyones cup of tea, but I can't give any negative points there, it was still good enough. It is worth to watch that movie in cinema.",1
193,"Definitely my new favorite movie from the brilliant Christopher Nolan. Interstellar was intense, thrilling, and highly ambitious on every level. It felt like an roller coaster ride but with some complex narrative structure in it. The first act of the story was a bit slow for me, but everything went FULL BLAST after that. Visually, its one of the best looking films of 2014...in my opinion. If you want the full experience from this film, then I highly recommend you go see it in IMAX. GOOOOO SEE IT IN IMAX!!! TRUST ME!!!!",1
194,"new level of cinematic experience , Interstellar is a excellent sci fi film,beautifully n brilliantly filmed awesome visual treat, good acting, very good direction , interstellar is a special experience of entertainment.",1
195,"Holy moly. When I first saw Interstellar I said ""wow, this is a moving picture, these pictures are moving to create a story of love, sacrifice and above all spaceships that twirl in outer space.""  Don't take my word for it, go out to your nearest video store and experience the unmatched match made in heaven that is Interstellar: This is a movie.",1
196,"INTERSTELLAR is not a perfect film. And in fact, the first hour tired me totally. If I were home, I would have shut it off BUT thank god I was not and did not. INTERSTELLAR simply blew me away.",1
197,"*Note: My Analysis and the real 'Nolan'/movie explanations may diverge.Abide with that. He is the monarch of all the **** flicks. :P Interstellar: ""Expect the Unexpected"" should be the tagline of every Nolan movie. Same goes for this movie as well. Interstellar is a dazzling, striving, fascinating journey. Interstellar is a smart blend of passions in a sci-fi movie. Nolanalways adds scarce emotions to all of his pictures which make me tearup all the time, but this is his most sentiment betrothed movie forsure. He has perfectly combined the bond between a dad and hisdaughter. This movie proves that our love can truly surpass time andspace; that no matter how remote that special someone be, they willalways matter to our hearts against the cold milieu of survival. Plot: The world is getting shattered by drought and famine, making itunbearable for beings to endure. In the meantime, Cooper finds asurreptitious NASA epicenter and goes out for a voyage to save theworld. A group of discovers must travel beyond our solar system insearch of another planet capable of Humankind. In the expedition, theyhad to face a lot of footraces which coerce them to select betweentheir family and the future of the human race. Now the movie goes quite clean till the first one and half hour. Afterthat, The Endurance crew gets to know the actual enigmas of this entiretrip. 1. The secret NASA center's Professor Brand has got two strategies ofsaving the civilization. First, he promises Cooper that he will solve aforward-thinking equation, which will help the NASA to take the Earth'ssurviving populace into the space by launching a massive space station.Second, if he fails in the solution, NASA has made pre-plans of reapinga bank of fertilized human ova serving them to keep alive the humanityafter earth gets wholly devastated. The Endurance's job is to find theflawless habitat for the subsistence of the embryos. They were to belocated in artificial wombs and carried to term. Of course, the crewwill devote the next 10-15 years taking care for a bunch of kids beforeusing the next set. The population bang would be exponential since thenext batch would be larger because there were more people available totake care of them. Later we got to know that entire journey was aswindle and Plan A was near to impossible. So plan B was the real plan. 2. Matt Demon [Dr. Mann]'s act was unforeseen. He proved that when youare in a dying condition, the only thing you care about is you and yourfamily and nothing else. The climax comes next. I personally believe that the movie should haveended in a different way. The paradox they shown in the film andMurph's apprehension of who ""the ghost"" was, to Matthew's realizingwhat was going on, to that specific scenario in the black hole, to himfinding his daughter and the full Murphy station sequence. I would haveadored if Coop would have died entering the Black Hole. The earth wouldhave died out and Anne Hathaway and Edmunds start a new civilization.
This would have left a cult ending, but Nolan always wants a twisted
finale to all of his flicks. Nevertheless, the actual climax was nice
as well.

Apart from this the other departments were bang on, Heart touching
acts, Superb Soundtrack, Wonderful DOP work, fabulous direction, etc. I
felt that there was a problem with the sound-mix. The subtitles
assisted well though.

Anyways, I loved this much, much, much more than Gravity. I hope
Interstellar gets plentiful Oscars this year like Gravity did.

Must watch!",1
198,"I've seen the movie yesterday and I must admit it I did not expect it will be that good. Mathew McConaughey is absolutely fantastic, the sound and the views are superb. The plot shows us that we are not ready to ""fight"" with time having our loved ones back home. Anyone having children will feel touched.See the movie for yourself - don't read the reviews. Everyone of us is different, and we decide what we like or dislike...",1
201,"Please let a black hole swallow all copies of this movie.  In fact, I will attempt to travel back in time and prevent it from ever being made.   Quite possibly the worst movie ever.  I teach ""space school,""  enjoy space movies in general, and really enjoy adventure stories, but this is very poorly done.  DO NOT purchase this on DVD, Blue Ray, or streaming service.  Save you money and your 2 hours, and 20 minutes.",0
202,"There was a movie named ""Contact"" which pretended to be a science fiction movie, until its fantasy/religious ending when the protagonist goes to heaven, says something about how poetry is more important than science and meets her dead father. Very much like ""Interstellar"". If that's your idea of a SF movie, go ahead. I actually hated it. Don't be fooled by Christopher Nolan's previous work - it's his worst film ever - or by the name of the physicist Kip Thorne in the credits (""Contact"" was also based on his - and Carl Sagan's - work, and see what happened). Some examples of the movie's ""physics"": A) scientists send a robot into a black hole so it can send data back to them from BEYOND the event horizon, B) planets orbiting a dark black hole (and nothing else) are illuminated by sunlight (!), C) the gravitational pull of the black hole rips everything apart, except the astronaut's body (magic!). More importantly, the reason why all humans must leave the Earth? Well, there are dust storms like in the 1930s in the middle of the USA, and some particular crops are affected by diseases. And that's pretty much it.",0
203,"I'm a big fan of hard science fiction. This movie is an absolute mess. I'm amazed at so many positive reviews. Pure trash in my opinion. Give me a Neill Blumkamp, Ridley Scott or James Cameron scifi movie anytime...",0
204,"Interstellar was ahead of its time, 20 years from now people will look back at this film and call it a ""Masterpiece"", Every thing from the writing to the acting was just perfect... The Visual Effects and Cinematography was ""Breathtaking"".",1
205,"Interstellar is a film for adults. A film for thinking adults. A film for adults who grew up in times of wonder and had to work hard for what they have today. A film for people mature enough to understand love and loss. Interstellar is a beautiful film, with a mesmerising music score to match its stunning visuals. The story is both fantastic and moving. The acting is top class and the writing is genius. If you love science fiction and have a sense of wonder and understand adult themes and emotions watch this film. You will love it.",1
206,"Another master piece from NOLAN. ""INTERSTELLAR"" is a well weaved net of shear brilliance. film has a great number of contents to offer, it has everything that can shook you to the toes . the movie did shoooook me! . Nolan simply slingshot to infinite distance in movie making industry, although there were some problems in the script the important 169 minutes offer everything one would expect. now its time to do some review on the movie. its screenplay is spectacular, more than INCEPTION. its only in my view . script gives us the glimpse of brilliance and hard work done by the film maker. he touched Stephan Hawking's BLACK HOLE PARADOX, Einstein's THEORY OF RELATIVITY everything physics had to offer. the movie starts with a silent, just to build on. Matthew McConaughey has done a great job to do this role. after slight introduction of human crisis Nolan tries to enter deep into charecter who lost his job, wife etc. the main charecter then enters to a voyage of script !. humanity is facing blight , human raise is struggling to produce food. every nation shut down their resources. whole of a kind is trying to make food.  McConaughey stumbles into a secret NASA space station by the help of his daughter's GHOST story. now we get glimpse of suspense that script has to offer. he took his chance there to rescue mankind ,joined with some more scientists which include Hathaway . they were trying to solve the problem with gravitational equation, another planet with life forms. before the expedition they select three potentially good chance planets and try to communicate. these hard knowing scenes may suggest little boring if you are not a fan of Nolan movies. story continues till they enter into each planet first one had nothing in it. next one produce more problems as it is conflicted with another scientist who has selfish nature and it all goes into third and most dangerous planet. meanwhile in earth already fourty something years passed. twist in the story happens when McConaughey  come to know about the fact that it was a sham, they were carrying life form to enhance new planet but not saving it . then the whole black hole thing comes all that drama sequence and then he fell into another five dimensional world where the rest of the story starts to reveal Matthew McConaughey gives his daughter secret to bend time and that is it . planet is saved then there is a glance into five dimensional world in future which was awesome to see. i was fascinated by thinking of growth of film makers in all these years. it is a must see movie.",1
207,"This is the most stupid sci-fi movie since Prometheus at least and definately Chris Nolan's worst movie so far. I had very high expectations from this movie considering all the talented people involved in it's production and thought that I would get to watch a film that asks some interesting questions and delves ito complex ideas, instead what I got was just another story about how love beats reason and science. Which in the hands of a more subtle director wouldn't have been so bad, but Nolan tends to make every character explain how he/she feels instead of just showing it. 90% of this movie is just expozition or characters holding speeches about how they feel which makes it very hard to relate to any of them. But the good visuals and great music makes this whole mess  pretty tollerable. Until the last 20 minutes at least. You really need to see to believe the black hole of stupidity that is the climax of this movie. Those were the most nonsensical 20 minutes I saw in recent memory. All logic and reason is tossed aside to make some lame speech about the power of love. I don't know what mind altering substances Nolan consumed when he wrote that ending  but it sure as hell it didn't fell like something the guy who wrote Inception and The Dark Knight would come up with. All in all: if you are someone who just want to watch a smart sci-fi movie or even a good film in general avoid this pretentious mess.",0
208,"Where do I begin to describe this movie? This movie just thrills and amazes.It shows you the possibilities of science, mankind, and life on the edge of hope and fear. The movie keeps you enticed and thrilled till the end, and it was not a moment too long. I just loved it and I think everyone should see this.",1
209,"Interstellar is a ambitious film you won't soon forget.  While there are times you feel exasperated by the science and trying to fit everything in place in your mind, the sheer spectacle is something to behold.  A-",1
210,The overall quality of the movie is far below what one would expect. The story has a weak logic and the representation of scientific theories (e.g. extradimensional world) is rather unsatisfactory. The movie is lengthy and boring. I cannot rank it at the level of Contact or Apollo 13.,0
211,"How many roads must a man walk down...to see so much corn? This is a rough and tumble, big chunk of a film that I really wanted to love: such potential. And to a great degree it is lovable work despite some of the miserable dialogue, miscasting and simple mumbled silly confusion that it is.  Nolan does not equal Kubrick. Really, you have to want to love it - and I do not want to discourage anyone from going to see it because there are some true hidden gems.   But the true potential was not reached, not even with help of a wormhole, a black hole, the talented Mr. Ripley or all the magic of the 5th dimension.  If love is the answer, you have to go through a heck of a lot of corn to find it.  SOS...if you listen clearly I am sending you a coded message from another dimension. Save  3 hours of your life - or we can assume that this is also relative.  Good luck, safe travels and don't forget to set a wake-up from the big nap on the way to Saturn.",0
212,"I came into the theatre expecting a great movie, similar to Nolan's other films, and that's what I got, sans a compelling story. The acting, cinematography, and CGI was great, but the story could have been more interesting. It had the themes like Inception, but it was not as interesting as I would have liked. However, it was still a great movie and, while not one of Nolan's best, is still worth seeing at the cinema.",1
213,"This movie was a complete let-down, to say the least. The fact that over 1000 people thought this movie was good is scary to think about.  Not one part of this movie made sense or became believable.  Now we understand why Matt Damon didn't want his name to appear anywhere.  Horrible, don't waste your money.  If you do decide to chance it, the first 20 minutes will clue you in - don't hesitate like we did, just leave and slip into a different movie.  I give this movie a negative 5. Oy Vey",0
214,"I have a theory that when film makers begin to think they are Shakespeare that's when they start producing 3-hour movies. It is even worse when actors begin to think they are Shakespeare because then they start producing really bad 3-hour movies. As a ""Reds"" survivor, I can testify to that. Luckily, Christopher Nolan is not an actor, but in producing ""Interstellar"", definitely the most cosmically bombastic space opera ever made, he is veering dangerously close to Shakespearean megalomania. The essential idea behind the movie is to realistically represent space travel and the space environment, which the movie succeeds in doing, if you consider the earth dying to ""climate change"", aliens opening wormholes next to Saturn, surviving travel into black holes and performing time travel through 5-dimensional tesseracts to be realistic. The production values of the film, though, on items such as uniforms, space gear, instruments, ships and stations is really outstanding. Space buffs will love the hardware. There are also detailed representations of the nuances of docking, orbital transfers and other astronautically cool stuff. Director/Writer Nolan does not produce all of this out of a vacuum. He takes a page out of the book of Space Odyssey 2001, more than a page actually. There is even a waltz. The scenes and special effects are also reminiscent of 2012's Prometheus and 2013's Oblivion. NASA obviously provided a lot of technical support. In fact the whole 3 hours sort of plays like an infomercial for NASA. Every space suit, ship and base station has NASA written all over it. I hope they paid him for all those placements. The shortcomings of the film are many, but the biggest problem is the casting. When one member of the affirmative action team to save the earth, intones ""This crew represents the best of humanity."" you can hardly keep from laughing. The players are the least believable astronauts in world. Crying, blubbering, screaming, and PMSing all over the screen. If humanity is the hands of these guys, we are in deep trouble. To top off the complete mis-cast, Matt Damon shows up out of the blue as a marooned space commander. You are scratching your head, wondering if you are watching ""Interstellar"" or ""Team America"". Ironically, this is not the first time Will Hunting has ruined a perfectly good film. He had another movie-sabotaging cameo 14 years ago in Finding Forrester (2000). You have to wonder what sexual favors are involved in casting decisions like these. The other misfire of the movie is the music. I think we should re-invade Europe and utterly destroy Germany this time, just so we do not have to listen to another Hans Zimmer score. I swear I need to start bringing ear plugs to showings. The score is so loud that in many scenes you cannot hear what the actors are saying, and I am not exaggerating. This would not be so bad if it only happened when the female lead was blubbering about her boyfriend, but on the contrary the loud music seemed to be reserved for those moments when they are explaining some technically complicated space math that you have to understand to follow the movie. So, you there yelling, ""Wait, the tesseract's dimensionality is folding when what happens? I need to hear that again!"" On the plus side, there are nice moments of silence illustrating the quietness of space, which is pretty quiet, because, you know, there is no air in space. The strength of the movie, besides the special effects, is the pacing and dynamism, which Nolan seems to have a complete knack for. His script here is not so good as 2008's ""The Dark Knight"", but he keeps things moving and involving as only he can. Overall, as long as you don't mind a minor possibility of long-term hearing loss and can stand the malaprop acting, ""Interstellar"" is very entertaining.",1
215,"Another great mind bender from the master. A great journey which makes the audience think about it for days after watching it. I'm definitely going to see it again. Try to watch it in IMAX if you can, it's an amazing experience for this movie!",1
217,"If there is one rule of a work of fiction, it is that you must care about the characters, because if you don’t care about the characters, it is very unlikely that you are going to care about what happens to them.And, alas, I have to admit, I wasn’t left caring about the characters by the end of this movie – the only characters I really ended up caring about were the faceless robots, who seemed to have more personality than the human cast did. And given that the movie itself was resolved with a deus ex machina, it is really hard to recommend.But I’m getting ahead of myself.The movie opens with some farmers, and it becomes clear a ways into the movie that this is a sort of post-apocalyptic Earth. The movie doesn’t do a great job of showing this in shorthand, and ultimately, the problem is that magical nitrogen-breathing microbes are, apparently, killing everything.Thus, humanity needs a new planet, and would-be-NASA Astronaut Joseph Cooper, who has turned to farming in the face of a global crop blight, needs to go to space to save the world by finding a new planet. But not just any sort of space trip – he’s going to go through a wormhole that someone has conveniently placed next to Saturn.Interstellar is ostensibly a sci-fi movie, but it is ultimately fantasy. The beginning of the movie has Cooper is lead to the secret NASA facility to become humanty’s savior by aliens from beyond space-time sending him the coordinates by writing in dust in his house and knocking books of the shelves of his daughter’s bookcase. A wormhole conveniently appeared next to Saturn to give humanity a way out of the solar system.And while this is all okay as setup, the movie continues to make contrivances. The ultimately solution to humanity’s plight is a deus ex machina delivered by aliens from beyond space-time – or possibly future humans. Whatever the case, it is a solution that comes not from the characters in the movie, but from an external force, meaning that, ultimately, all of the characters struggles were resolved by magic as well.If the characters had been interesting, this might have been okay. But they weren’t. The central conflict of the movie – Cooper having to choose between saving people who already exist, and providing for a potential future for the human species – was potentially interesting, but ultimately, the movie doesn’t really go anywhere with it. Cooper is upset, certainly, but in the end nothing Cooper did really ended up resolving that conflict – it was resolved in his favor by external forces, and there’s no actual human resolution to it. Without any other personality to speak of - just these two character traits - he's not really a very interesting character.His costar is Dr. Amelia Brand, a fellow astronaut who seems generally nice and sort of focused on the future. She is in love with one of the astronauts who was sent out before them and hopes to rescue them, but the most important thing to her is the future of humanity. However, there’s very little real personality here – again, I can’t list off more than a couple of character traits. She’s rather flat as a character, and just sort of is there.And this problem is endemic to the cast – most of them feel like they’re just kind of there, and have maybe two personality traits tops. Only Michael Caine’s doctor character and Matt Damon’s Dr. Mann, the astronaut survivor who they find, feel at all like real people – and in both cases, it is quickly undermined by the plot. Dr. Mann in particular is problematic – he notes how lonely he felt and how scared he was of dying alone, but then tries to murder people for no real reason while talking about saving humanity. It is bizarre and nonsensical, and consumes a big chunk of the movie’s run-time for no real reason.TARS and CASE, the two robots that are brought along on the spaceship, show more personality than the entire human cast – TARS is snarky, and the back-and-forths between TARS and the human cast are the best character moments in the movie. TARS and CASE feel like the real heroes to some extent, and honestly leave me wondering why they didn’t just send robots, as they are apparently both clever and adaptable. I enjoyed their wise-cracking, and their roles felt like the most interesting ones.Sadly, they were not enough to carry the movie, and we’re left with a plodding 2 hour and 40 minute long film that doesn’t leave earth until 42 minutes in. My lack of concern for the characters meant that their success and failure didn’t touch me, and the constant contrivances meant I couldn't care about the plot. In the end, it felt like I was being drug by the nose through something full of puppets on strings, attempting to tell an arbitrary story without much real substance to it.",0
218,"Nonsense science coupled with a glacial pace of events and dull, predictable dialogue makes for a stinker of a movie.  Luckily I was able to catch a long nap during the endless tedium of this artless lump of a movie so I was spared some of the pain.  For any serious fans of hard scifi based even loosely on current theory, this is a waste of time.",0
219,"It may not be as mindblowing as Inception, but it paints a clear picture of unworldly desolate journey in very personal level. Aside from the heavy emphasis of space flight, ""Human is explorer"" as the movie aptly described, the best part of the movie is relationship between humans themselves, mainly between Cooper and Murph. Visual is pleasant, the science is sound and atmosphere is grimly right, although the pace can be pretty slow at times. The movie serves as inspiration and education purpose, captivating audience with not just boring lecture but also with good simulation on how lives can be affected by the prospect of unforeseeable future. Story is very heavy with scientific elements, there is much information to absorb and it could be overwhelming for those who aren't accustomed to sci-fi genre. To its credit, the movie tries to explain many complicated aspects as brief and as clear as possible, it can't be faulted with lack of research. The first act does take some time to roll, but for a good reason. Matthew McConaughey brings top notch acting in recent years, but perhaps his best one is this father-daughter relationship with Murph (Jessica Chastain). It's very believable, dynamic, occasionally amusing and thoroughly emotional. Jessica Chastain pulls off a great performance, better than her older counterparts. Michael Caine, an old time accomplish to Nolan, as Depp to Burton, is fantastic as usual. There's so much depth to his character, much thanks to his natural parental charisma. Anne Hathaway plays as Brand, another astronaut with strong conviction but slight self-doubt. Every character here is flawed, there's no one with hero mentality, and it's more authentic to see them trying to solve their issues with such imperfection. Hathaway is more of a comrade than love interest, someone who shares the unique same fate, her tight suit will be missed though. Writing is quite brilliant, very solid and humorous when needs be. It balances the complex stuff with simpler tone to ensure audience can still relate. Props to writers for making the robotic characters very lively even as they lumber around in metal case. Visual is littered with the gray tone of Nolan. This fits the estranged worlds and empty space, it's less blockbuster than previous galactic voyage of Gravity, but appealing on its own right. Music from Hans Zimmer is undoubtedly excellent, he hits the right tune and delivers some creeping moments of solitude. The overall sound effect is also good, transitioning between vacuum space and mechanic growl perfectly. The movie's production level is sky high. Interstellar is admittedly a bit slow at times, it's inspirational but not as cinematically engaging and entertaining as Nolan's previous works. It manages to create a lonely perspective, a daunting self-reflective insight of human significant, or insignificant in cosmos time, but the best part about the movie is the bonds, might it be parental, platonic or romantic, or even robotic. In the end the star is the humans that make the equation more meaningful.",1
222,"Interstellar is definitely the best movie of the year, this movie is just amazing, what can I say, is just nolan's movie, has a very solid argument, like his best movies, like the dark knight or inception, amazing effect, epic soundtrack, incredibles pictures, I didn't realize how fast the hours has gone, very entertaining film, I must say that it isn't an easy movie to understand, demands a little concentration, to get all its points, I need to see it again... but mega ultra recommended!!! 9/10",1
223,"Without giving anything away, the basic plot line is this:  Earth is dying, and the only way to save the human race may be to relocate to another planet.  Something out there seems to be trying to show us the way, but exactly what we need to do is murky.  Fortunately, despite a severe lack of resources on earth, NASA has become a secret agency and has a rocket ship ready.  The trip into space will be dangerous and without any guarantee of success, but what choice is there?The director seems to want us to believe that we always a choice and that it may be our inner personality, as much as anything, that drives our decision making.  The movie also spends a lot of time trying to convey how terribly lonely, emotionally wrenching, and potentially mentally debilitating it would be to spend extended periods of time alone in space, and that such trips are equally damaging to the emotions of those left behind on earth.  Ultimately, the movie has good dramatic tension, but the director’s attempts to create emotional tension end up being a lot of interstellar flotsam and jetsam.At times this movie can also be confusing, but will be less so if you keep in mind one of Einstein’s more bizarre discoveries:  Time is not absolute, but is a function of motion.  It passes more slowly for people traveling at very high speeds, relative to people who are moving more slowly.  (You may also want to keep in mind that Einstein’s theories do not allow for travel back in time.)At 2hrs 45min this is a relatively long movie, but it moves along quickly enough that you won’t feel like time has come to a total standstill.  It contains an all-star cast, but some (like Matt Damon, Michael Caine) seem a bit miscast.  Others (namely Ellen Burstyn) are unrecognizable.  I don’t see any Oscar nominations for acting in this movie.The movie has some tangential (and probably unavoidable) similarities to 2001: A Space Odyssey.  For one, there is an intelligent (Hal-like) robot with a (human-like) personality, and you will ponder whether it’s going to develop some sort of (machine-like) schizophrenia that will cause it will override its programming and act against its human cargo in favor of preserving the mission.  For another, the movie purposely leaves some questions unanswered.  At the end it leaves you saying, “wait a minute” and you will be replaying the opening scenes in your mind to try and figure out if the actions of Mr. McConaughey make any sense at all.It may not sound like it but, overall, I liked this movie.  Only time will tell if it is destined to develop a ‘cult classic’ status, but my initial reaction is “Uhmmn, no.”",1
224,"Firstly, I reluctantly gives scores for films in general but if I have to it's the one above..... One thing struck me looking at user reviews for this films, almost everyone gave it a low score or a high score, ""love it or hate it"" I suppose, Though I didn't feel this. In my opinion films like this should be experienced subjectively but critiqued objectively. Many people said the music overwhelmed the actors, dialogue, etc... sure, maybe, but why can't the film's score be a CHARACTER in a film sometimes? Remember how important the music was in Inception? Many films would be almost unimaginable without the music, it becomes a crucial part of the film like Dances With Wolves or There will Be Blood, some films don't need it at all like No Country for Old Men (that's right NO music, seriously). Some even said the casting was bad, which made me laugh because I couldn't imagine many people spouting philosophical jargon and pithy, humorous, comments better than McConaughey, after all, almost all the performances were very good also. Other people have mentioned ""plot holes"" which I think they're confusing with script choices, I'm not saying they were good or bad, just different. Could Nolan have shown us more development with McConaughey's character? perhaps. Or, ceased with the scientific ""lingo""? Maybe, though I feel like it was quite straight forward in most parts. These are simple choices made by a filmmaker, and lets not forget the fact that its called SCIENCE FICTON for a reason, it's ficton, not real. A lot of people seem to be missing this point entirely with ideas that certain elements of this film weren't logical, etc, or failed to explain certain things. My critic of other people's critic continues with the one of the main aspects of the film with the ""5th Dimension"" idea. People seemed to have a problem with it, like me at first. I soon realised that this is Nolan we're talking about, the guy who left us wondering weather Di Caprio's character at the end of Inception was really awake or not. Could we not give the benefit of the doubt and assume for a second that this was McConaughey's fate as well? Maybe he was being metaphorical? or perhaps installing some symbolism into the film? For my mind a filmmaker makes two films, one part for him and the other for the audience, knowing full well that the audience isn't going to fully comprehend every single thing in the film the filmmaker might well be inclined to write in some ideas of his own that make the film worth making in the first place. To this effect and for the following reasons I believe the ""5th dimension"" element to be, while on the surface an integral part of the plot, simply just means to an end. Firstly, unlike many American films about the end of the world, etc, we have no mention of God, religion, etc, just a small subplot about ""ghosts"" so in my mind this is Nolan's ""God"", the ""5th dimension"" is that unexplained feeling that was discussed in the film, the ""love"" of the film is physicalized here. The instruments used in Hans Zimmer's music gives it an every spiritual feel for no obvious reason since to film has nothing to do with spirituality per say, except for those of us who subjectively inject that into the film, which is fine. So in that respect I felt like he was underlying these themes musically, really driving home that idea we can't touch certain things in this life but can certainly feel them, no matter what the explanation. Also, two last things on this subject, several moment in the film there were discussions on death and what we experience when we die, one line describes that when we die we see our children, this happens to McConaughey in this moment, why take it so literally? Could it not be that he simply seeing his beloved at his most lonely terrifying moment? Lastly, the plain fact that after the ""5th dimension"" McConaughey awakes, barely alive, suddenly outside the orbit of Saturn awaiting a rescue ship. Really? or could it be a ""Nolanism"". Overall, I'm not thinking this a 8 or 9 out of 10, and certainly not what other people are giving it, I think swinging either way is a mistake because while many of the films, as well as the execution is stunning, it's still a flawed film as many are, I just believe in looking into things a little closer before sending them to slaughter. Many reviews, both user and professional seem to miss crucial aspects of films when they watch them, especially when one bothers to write: ""Boring, Boring, Boring"", etc..... why bother unless you're willing to explain your actual thoughts in an intelligent and concise way?",1
225,"This movie was a supreme letdown.Overly long with dragged out scenes. That It had some good actors is about the only redeeming aspect to it.It should have been cut down by at least 30 minutes. Superfluous scenes reigned supreme in this flick.A total waste of time.",0
229,"I expected more from Interstellar. The movie is intense and beautifully shot, but you cannot deny the existence of flaws in the plot! Not the best Nolan's work",1
232,"Mind Boggling Visuals, Voice dominant Score, Matthew Mcconaughey's splendid performance and some paradoxical plot holes make movie little flat but still Nolan's exceptional direction makes it a delight to watch. I believe this Space Sci-Fi drama needs more humor treatment than quantum physics conversations for PG13 to understand. But still it is one of the movies which is larger than life and something which needs dare to attempt. Kudos to Makers.",1
233,"Interstellar looks and feels great most of the time but is not without problems and errors.Aside from some questionable actions done by the main protagonists and the usual Hollywood ending, Interstellar tries really hard to be scientifically accurate. The result is that all the small and big scientific errors are therefore much more noticeable.While the first two thirds left me impressed, the ending was rather unsatisfying.",1
234,"I am not a science fiction fan, but out of all the science fiction films that i've watched. This is my favorite. Christopher Nolan took this film to the other level. The way he portrayed each character is amazing. However, i feel that the ending could've been better.",1
236,"This movie is ridiculous from the point of view of science and also regarding human relationships.  Matthew M is terrible, completely unconvincing, sort of a hillbilly scientist.  and the father-daughter relationship was sentimental and absurd.  really worrisome that top critics bought this - shows how bad movies are in general that this one was promoted.",0
238,"I am a sci-fi but just couldn't buy much if any of the story line or science in this film.  Why did time fly by so fast on the water planet but apparently not so fast on the ice planet or on the ship while traveling out there? From what I understand of the theory is that time passes by relatively slower when traveling  faster than the speed of light. And why faster while on a planet surface than on the ship.  How was the ship not demolished by the tidal wave?  How did Murph get to be such an educated physicist in a school that denied the existence of the Apollo missions?  Ejecting yourself in a black hole across the galaxy has you winding up at a doorway in time behind the bookshelf of your daughter's bedroom and how did he even get back after that?  Some have commented that folks that complained that the movie was convoluted or overly complex are just not smart enough to understand the movie. I would counter that merely throwing out complex concepts applied inconsistently in a random fashion does not constitute a great ""thought provoking"" film, especially with all the gaping holes in the plot itself.  The only thought it provoked in me after about an hour or so was how I could apply the science in the movie to speed up time to get this movie over with?",0
239,"Available on Amazon Prime, I'm glad I didn't pay to see this in the theater. Expecting great visuals, we instead get long shaky cam scenes that might as well have been Star Trek TV episodes of anonymous, red shirted crewmen bouncing off of walls, space shots that we've all seen before and a very confused script. Any attempt to create tension was forced and tedious. My butt hurts. Totally boring mess of a film.",0
241,"I enjoyed Interstellar very much, though I think it is not a perfect film.Warning, spoilers:First, I have several problems with Interstellar.1) One is that Dylan Thomas quote, ""Do not go gentle into that good night"" is too literal for the situation. It irritated me that Nolan decided to quote it over and over.2) Matt Damon's character was obviously going to go bugnuts and off everyone. This was telegraphed the moment he woke up.3) Adult Murph, played by Jessica Chastain, burned the corn. I thought she was pretty desperate to help her sister-in-law and niece, because she might end up burning them with the corn.4) Tom (Casey Affleck) comes back after putting out the fire, Jessica Chastain tells him (I think) their dad was talking to them through her watch and hugs him. With Murph's boyfriend Topher standing there with a tire wrench, Tom might conclude that Murph was burgling his house, or might even realize she started the fire, which she did. I fully expected him to punch her for coming back to their house.Nevertheless,1) I truly bought the idea man will stop exploring space and start saying the Moon landing was a lie. We are stupid enough to do that to ourselves.2) I fully support this movie's pro-space agenda. It has its flaws, but I pray that it will be a box-office hit and have us looking to the stars again.3) I love the space scenes, especially the wormhole and the black hole.4) I love the space colony scene in the end, with people living in huge cylinders.5) Chastain/Foy/Burstyn fully sold me on their father/daughter relationship with McConaughey. This is very important in accepting the film.",1
243,"Despite a stellar journey through space and emotion, Interstellar unnecessarily became Nolan-ized in its third act. It's not quite enough to have brilliant visuals and formidable acting throughout--we're looking for a better conclusion.",1
244,"SPOILERSI was really looking forward to this and it started out well enough but deteriorated quickly. As soon as Anne Hathaways character started talking about love being some 5 dimensional yoke I dismissed the movie as yet another 'sci-fi' written by someone that hasnt a clue about science. Seriously,are these creative types so insecure they have to constantly remind everyone that 'love' and 'creativity' trump reason and intellect? And yet again the main scientists turn out to be evil or supremely arrogant - apparently its a prerequisite if you have any desire to understand how the universe ACTUALLY works. Watch this one on blu ray - dont bother with the cinema.",0
247,"Too dumb for nerds, too smart for jocks, this movie panders to those between but suffers from too many incoherent lapses in reality to sustain disbelief and not enough explosions to keep the masses entertained. This movie fails on so many levels you may actually feel the effects of the relativity of time as its three hour span drones one for what seems like ten years.The science of the movie is a mish mash of poorly conceived ideas and concepts the authors obviously do not understand and anyone with an iota of intelligence tunes out the minute they realize it takes rockets to actually sent the shuttle out of Earth's orbit but that the nifty little craft can hop onto and off any other planet with ease (even ones with significantly stronger gravities).I don't need science to be perfect in my sci fi flicks. Fact is, I'd rather do without (the best sci fi usually does). However, if you're going to use science as a main plot element, you have to get it right or make it fuzzy enough to remain plausible. The ironic pseudo science of Hitchihiker's Guide to the Galaxy is actually more believable than the drivel served up in this fiasco.The few highlights of this film are those reminiscent of Gravity and Apollo 13 and even these are not as poignant or well done as the originals.But above and beyond all of its failings, this movie fails most utterly because it is ultimately boring.",0
249,This was a fabulous movie.......not!  How's about a coherent story line to start with; eh?  What would possess big name stars to even consider acting in this dog?  Wow.  Or should I say (bow) wow.,0
251,"Incredibly boring and self indulgent! Why do ""space opera"" movies have to be such a slog. Anne Hathaway kept driving home the fact that she's supposed to be a scientist and in then middle of the movie starts all this crap about involving love into the equation. WTH was that? Matt Damon serves to real purpose in this movie, in fact most of the peripheral cast is useless and one note in this feature. Subtlety is definitely not Nolan's strong point as he sees fit to explain a lot of details in such a scripted and droll manner almost like people are simply reading off the cue cards. This movie is 1 1/2 hrs too long. The robots are really laughable and cringe inducing. I feel embarassed for Nolan especially the part where Hathaway's character gets herself into a jam due to stubborness and stupidity. That scene was really awful and the way one of the characters died was pathetic. Just watch this on Blu-ray so you're not forced to sit throught the whole thing. Collapse",0
252,"Comparing this movie to ""2001"" is like comparing a turd to chocolate ice cream because they are both brown. If somebody tries telling you that this movie is somehow related or equivalent, don't talk to that person again. They don't know. I'm just happy to know that when we are all out of food, we will still be able to kick back, look cool in our Carhartt jackets, and drink a beer on a porch. This movie actually tries to play the ""You're the only man for the mission"" card, because apparently their highly intelligent robots can't be sent into space because they made them clumsy as hell. The music is really loud (though really good, and powerful) to cover up poor dialogue. You have to ignore the plot holes, otherwise you will want to pull your hair out. Pretty much, this movie is beautiful **** Also, Nolan, come on - don't do the upside-down world parlor trick again. We saw it in inception. Move on.",0
254,"So I finally got to watch this movie now that it hit Netflix. This movie was hyped to high heavens to me by few people I sometimes play and talk on the internet, and couple of IRL friends. Some of them even said it was ""life changing"" and that they'd want ""something like in Interstellar"" from their lifes. So, what did I think of Interstellar? disappointment. It was cheesy, slow, dumb piece of film. It was clearly aimed towards audience that has never properly watched multiple scifi shows. It was clearly aimed to get people into astronomy. Welp, it seems it did just that. It is a scifi movie, but dumb one. It has a NASA pilot that does cheesy ""tell me what wormholes were again?"" just for the audience... RETIRED NASA PILOT. Same guy that hacked (old?) military drone apparently with advanced AI earlier from the sky to land, while driving, on laptop. Oh and they did that going through corn field, in a starving world in which that corn is needed. ... Now that I've got myself going, how about I tell you about the ending of the movie? ... Our main guy the NASA pilot saved humanity in the end by going into the super massive blackhole (without any kind of spaghetification effect... what wasted opportunity!), to learn what was inside of blackhole, so we could figure out some kind of space manipulation magic technology, only hey 10-20 minutes into inside of an blackhole, we learn that they did not end up in a blackhole, they ended up inside ""tesseract"", ""4th dimension"" in which time can be traversed like going to next room, which is then told to be construct of future humanity to quide their past self into their future glorious space manipulation magic technology, (so it really is not blackhole, its not even 4th dimension!) so hey that guy was at no point actually inside of an blackhole learning what it was like inside one, what actually happens at singularity, since he was transported into this magical ""tesseract"" structure by the future mankind, so how the f did they even learn what it was like inside blackhole to develope this magical space manipulation technology, dont ask me, because conveniently his robot buddy box bot just happens to have this magical technology that gathers this ""quantum data"" from inside a black hole without actually being inside one. Man, this movie is so dumb. So cheesy. It's like Doctor Who episode that outstayed it's welcome with slow, overdramatic scenes. It's got so much cheesy stuff even Doctor will fly down to ""tesseract""  with his Tardis to ask for some of that cheese. It's got so much soap opera in it even folks at Stargate Universe want some of that soap! ... I dislike this movie. With passion. I expected something worth of all this fuss. Something ground breaking. What I got was Doctor Who without The Doctor.",0
255,"I was so excited to see Interstellar because the movie had such great reviews.  The movie was such a disappointment. It was 3 hours of scientific hogwash that dragged an hour and a half longer than it needed to be.  The space scenes were so unrealistic.  They were weightless in space but their hair was in perfect style!!! The relationship between the father and daughter was touching and heartwarming, but that was the only highlight of the movie.  This movie may have received good ratings from someone, but the people walking out after the movie all had the same comments.  ""The movie was way too long and strange"".",0
256,"There was 30 minutes of this movie that was worth watching. After that, there were the story lines (oh, so many of them), the sound management or lack there of (allowing the score to be louder than the actors is still wrong. We want to hear what they are saying....or use subtitles please), the dangling plots (hmm, there were a lot of them too), the useless need to stack actors in a movie for no reason (hmmm, why was Matt really there?), the misuse of time travel(guess some writer just wanted to add that to the mix since the butterfly effect had just been used recently), the addition of a love story gone wrong in space (Poor Ann), and why didn't NASA go out and find their No. 1 man? Thank goodness Mathew looked down on the floor, or the movie would have gone on a lot longer. Say, what did happen to that drone in the beginning of the movie? Why was that even put in the mix of the plot?  Remove sections of this movie and would it still ""fly"". It took four major production companies to finance this ""ship"", they should have Michael Cane's character's lines and follow them.... ""...it was all a scam"". Over an hour too long, too many separate directions of plots, useless adding of characters, and to top it all off...making the father step out of the room to allow dying daughter to be with her family instead of her long lost father...yes, please dig the knife in deeper please. Great work, were any of these writers contracted to ruin recent television story lines in the past or present too (like Flash Forward or Resurrection)? Stanley Kubrick would be (okay, nicely...) very upset if he were in this audience watching this movie (that is, unless he helped produced it too). Six people  of various ages walked out an hour before the movie ended. Glad the actors and crew were paid. For those who don't see the movie... you saved three hours of your life!P.S. Reason for allowing 2 to this score... the robots and their concept use and the one planet with the ocean. The idea was the best.",0
257,"As a movie it's pretty good. Acting is solid and matthew mcconaughey is really good. Supporting cast was solid to really good. Music is great, it does a great job of capturing the scale Of e visuals and the ideas. The script is solid. Nothing particularly amazing about the dialog, but it's far from weak. Visuals are phenomenal, I didn't see it in IMAX and even then it looked impressive. Now, here's the downside I feel. Throughout the movie there's a certain underlining mystery developing. Questions get asked and built up to a reveal. Now, admitidley I predicted the main surprise pretty early on, I don't feel like its all hat hard. But even then, how we get there should be the fun. And at first it does REALLY well. Then we get to the part where everything begins to reveal itself and... Yea. I respect that this movie deals with theoretical science and things like that. But I feel like the ending was just a bunch of convoluted ideas patched together around a decent core plot line over the last 15 minutes or so. I know everyone has different tastes, but like 2001, I honestly think its just a bunch of random ideas strewn together and were ment to look at it and go ""wow. It's so deep man"" and because the director is (deservedly) one of the most respected directors of the time. TLDR: It's a new 2001 A Space Odyssey. If you found some sort of deep meaning to it then you'll love this. If you didn't like it because it just seemed like a jumbled confusing and almost pretentious in a way ending. Then this won't change your mind.",1
258,"This is a stream of consciousness movie which made me think the writer was insane.  A mismosh of thoughts and ideas with no connection to each other.  The sound of the dialogue was difficult to hear and the news is the movie was made that way.  Similar to the movie Gravity but much more of a jumble of ideas and thoughts.  It tried to get it point across in a grueling 2 1/2 showing but I don't think any amount of time could save it..  If you liked the style of Gravity you may like it, if you didn't -- run.  For me it was a waste of popcorn.",0
259,"I was expecting to enjoy this film but found it a massive letdown. The characters, other than the robots were dull and annoying, the script was terrible, and the soppy nonsense and preposterous oh so convenient and heart warming ending detracted from everything that came before.",0
261,"Beyond belief and we are supposed to believe this.  Nice performances, but it makes no sense, even for a sci fi fable.  I had to leave 2/3 through.  Yuck.  The scenery was great and the images done well, but the story just was not believable..",0
262,"I'm extremely confused with this movie, is it sci-fi or fantasy, you know somewhat of a fairytale... I'm huge fans of physics, cosmology, astronomy and everything what is associated with that, but this movie just breaks apart in the middle of it. I mean seriously, Nolan went to far with his imagination, he should have stick with the sci-fi genre, but instead he involves some stupid **** about love. I'm hardly trying to understand reasoning of doing such unexpected twist that is almost most cheesy twist in sci-fi movies history. On the other hand I can't say it's a bad movie. The visuals are great, part of the plot is decent, acting is very good (especially for a sci-fi movie), so I'm don't even know what to think, how should I rate it. Ok, so finally I think Nolan should stick with planet Earth and not go into space again, I mean never again. I can give it 7/10 for the good parts",1
263,"I was looking forward to this film all year, and now it's finally out i can say that it was a little disappointing, not terrible, just not great. For the most part the film is a lot of fun, creating a believable world that could easily represent humanities future, with some good acting and amazing effects the first hour or so of this movie was very enjoyable to watch. Then the downsides play in, one of which could have just been the cinema i was in but i have seen this comment elsewhere too, and that is that the music was so unbelievably deafeningly loud that you cannot hear key dialogue points and because of this draws you out of the story and leaves you feeling annoyed after any action scene turns up. My biggest annoyance with this film though has to be the ending, it seemed like Nolan was going more for a remake of 2001: A Space Odyssey and make an ending which is overly complicated and more of a Deus Ex than actually put in a decent ending to the movie. Overall i enjoyed this movie, but i believe it fell just short of being a classic by just a few odd decisions, in my opinion anyway.",1
264,"""Interstellar"" 10 Scale Rating: 7.0 (Good) ... The Good: At times, the film is gripping and borders on epic. The characters are well written and fleshed out. McConaughey turns in one of the best performances that I have ever seen him give and his supporting cast (Hathaway, Caine, Affleck, Chastain, Bentley, and Damon) are also superb. The scientific aspects are fascinating and the science geek in me was very entertained for stretches. Nolan's depiction of the fall of humanity feels realistic (even if it's a tad preposterous) and hits home. Also, as McConaughey drifts further and further away from his family, you feel it. Well done, for the most part. The Bad: At just under three hours, the film is too long. I personally don't usually mind lengthy films, but at times it feels drawn out for the sake of drawing it out ... especially near the end. Eventually, all the bad luck that the crew faces starts to wear on you. It feels near constant and also puts them in situations that they get out of by performing impossible feats or suddenly have a stroke of good luck instead. Lastly, the technical aspects will lose some. While I enjoy hearing people chat about time/space distortion, relativity, event horizons, and quantum physics ... I can only listen to so much of it and can't imagine how someone who ISN'T interested in those subjects would feel.",1
265,"my first review on metacritic. yay. too bad it's on the negative side of things.. i mean to start, even though i'm a total scifi-nut, the general plot of the movie seemed nonsensical to me. first off : the dustbowl blight calamity seemed adoptable, even via today's technology, like adopting aquaponics and vertical urban farming systems on a massive scale to boost production and genetically engineer crops to be more blight resistant. which is why the movie's main hook for selling us the ""we aren't supposed to save this world, we're supposed to leave it"" propaganda falls a bit flat. coz i think they should've chosen the ""we leave this planet to explore space via our own choice, not because we have no other choice left"" approach. which feels more apt. (or at the very least, cook up a more plausible earth-destroying calamity than crop blight.. lol) then there's the wormholes left by seemingly benevolent aliens which gave humans this russian roulette-like options for survival instead of just pointing us at the right direction in the first place, as well as the gravitational relativistic time message sent by space dad inside a  room in the blackhole prepped by aliens, were blatant examples of deus ex machina, which is just another lame way of saying ""we ran out of plausible ideas, so here's some metaphysical/supernatural crap so we can just dumb it down to an emotional level"" besides, benevolent highly intelligent aliens going through all that round-about trouble seemed highly inefficient to me. if the nolan brothers were so adamant to put benevolent aliens in their plot, the very least they could've done is made them efficient. the problem is that benevolent highly intelligent aliens would probably just drop down on earth, learn basic human language, then write.. ""build more aquaponic systems to solve your dustbowl crop blight problems.. stupid. here, take these blight resistant seeds and start planting.. adieu"".. problem solved. interstellar is like the recent equivalent of the movie ""Contact"", and stumbling upon the same lame metaphysical plot-hole of space dads. so it's kinda hard to recommend this movie other than for the ""scientifically accurate"" visual effects which the scientific community seems to be applauding it for.. anyways, is it so much to ask for a scifi movie where a ""problem"" is actually solved by plausible ""solutions""?i mean, it's scifi for chrissakes, a good chunk of the target audience tend to get quite cerebral on their tech musings, so if the problem-solution aspect isn't very interesting in the first place, then that should've given the nolan brothers the clue to rewrite it from a different angle. so to top things off, after watching interstellar, the only wormhole that' was actually of great import was the flimsy connection between plot point A to plot point B.. it's like a whole new inception level of mind-numbing madness.",0
266,"What a pile of overwrought, sentimental, manipulative folderol. It's hard to imagine anyone could tolerate this mess much less praise it.Acting? McCounaughey is the new Nick Cage, practically a parody of himself.Michael Caine couldn't save it! Goodbye cruel world, boohoohooo....The movie really lost me when they took this high tech craft, landed on an ocean and then didn't have the technology to know how big the waves are and how close these are? After that, the movie was on, but I found other things to pass the time.I love sci fi and can watch a lot of crap, but this didn't even come close to anything but a tearjerker in a time warp.",0
267,"This film is not only preposterous, which is OK for a sci-fi, it is all around BAD! Bad plot, bad acting, bad direction, bad science. Most characters seem to go into hysteria every few minutes I suppose to add emotion  - not emotional, stupid. The science is so bad it's not worth commenting on. It would appear that Mr Nolan has seen Kubrick's 2001 and not having any ideas of his own decided to make a sequel, but lacking the genius of Kubrick Nolan created this pos. If you have an IQ under 90, you'll love this film.",0

269,"About an hour too long, the movie was pretty and well put together but completely spoilt by a script with so many plot holes as to make it cringeworthy, especially the last 40 minutes which dragged the movie from being average to subpar.",0
270,"Wow - I am impressed. Nolan could not have made this worse if he tried. I never thought I'd see any SF movie worse than Prometheus, but this takes the cake. Your typical 11 year old (well, at least in my country, where we take education seriously) could point out the major flaws in the attempts at ""science"" in this movie, but even the drama suffers from implausible and inconsistent ""deus ex machina"" style constructs. I hope anyone who gave this more than a 0 got a hefty payoff from the publishers, otherwise I fear for the future of mankind.",0
271,"I'm embarrassed for the human race that this is getting good reviews. This movie presents itself as  ""hard"" science fiction in the vein of 2001,  but wimps out and goes all SyFy Channel the second it becomes convenient. Suddenly there's massive time dilation just by landing on a slightly higher gravity planet?  Huh?  And NOTHING can escape a black hole...so CALL ME ON YOU RADIO when you fall into one. Oh, and forget the ACTUAL (and infinite) time dilation that would occur while you're in there.  The Stupid is strong with this one.   It's infuriating that the whole movie acts like it's toeing the line on physics (no warp drive, no sound in space, use of orbital mechanics, etc), but then slaps you across the face with complete scientific ignorance.  Five minutes of Googling would've disproved the central concepts of this project, but I guess that was too much work. Nolan reveals himself as a fool who's absorbed just enough Science(y) Fiction to be dangerous, and sadly that's appealing to a bunch of people who share his ignorance.  A thousand face palms and increased pessimism for the longevity of our species.",0
274,"Hey kids! Let's make a movie... I have a famous director and several top 'pretty' actors, and a few aging actors of good reputation. I have millions to spend on loud, visually explosive effects. Oh, wait.... oh never mind, who needs a writer when you have all this cool stuff? This was long, dreary, disjointed, non-sensical... trying to jerk every string without any real emotional weight. It blatantly stole from every major sci-fi movie, from Forbidden Planet thru 2001 to Contact and synthesized nothing much original (and a nod to a PBS doc about the Dust Bowl thrown in for some reason). Instead of developing any real passion, it used disturbingly tight camera-work, loud noise, crying and breathlessly whispered voices to try and make us feel for the surprisingly wooden acting. I'll give it a 2 just for having some decent rocket-launch footage (borrowed from NASA).",0
276,Too much time crunching and some very unbelievable events...I love space movies but sometimes less is best. 6.5 would be my score......metacritic should allow scores out of 100.,1
277,"I thought Interstellar was the 2014 answer to Stanley Cubrick's 2001, A Space Odyssey, but it was a far cry from it. Interstellar is not the existential journey of mankind to a new habitat, instead its a Hollywoodian tearjerker based upon fake sentiments with just outer space as scenery.",0
280,"Nothing in this movie makes any sense even on the level of science fiction. It is a complete waste of time. If they had advisers with scientific knowledge, who were they?",0
281,"I don't know which film was the worse I seen. ""Interstellar"" or ""Fifty Shades Of Gray"". ""Interstellar"" was a long boring movie that delt with ....????  I defy anyone to explain this absolutely b.s. story line. And don't start with my IQ being so low. This movie was an insult to my IQ as I sat thru the entire movie constantly looking at my watch. Why I didn't walk out on this piece of crap is still a mystery to me. And what really is amazing is that the movie took in over $600 million dollars!!!  Which means more of the same to come. The story line was completely over the top. Especially the ""book case"" scene near the end of the movie. I can't believe the high ratings this movie got. Walking to my car there were three woman and a guy going in the same direction. One of the woman asked me what I thought of it. I told them I though it was a piece of sh....!  All three woman yelled ""Yes!!!"" and started in on the poor guy that was with them. A waste of three hours was one of the comments. I would never ever watch this movie again on dvd or add it to my dvd collection. Horrible, horrible movie.",0
282,"It's certainly a spectacle, and it's certainly complex, but being complex doesn't make it smart. The film's payoff is just stupid. Sure, the many errors in plausibility can be written off; science fiction has taken dramatic license before. But whatever is inside a black hole, a father sending gravity-based messages through time to his daughter is not it. Not literally, and not metaphorically, either. The real lesson to be learned from space travel is that humanity is a speck in the cosmos, not that emotional bonds between people can defy the laws of physics. Beyond this central thematic failure, Interstellar is unsatisfying. The level of coincidence involved in Coop finding and being recruited into the mission defies logic. His motivations are never well developed, and the pithy observations of him and other characters are never earned. The other characters are even sketchier; and the bizarre Matt Damon cameo is ham-handed. And like his betrayal and the identity of the ""ghost"", important plot twists were telegraphed. The obvious comparisons to Interstellar are Gravity (space-driven IMAX spectacle), Sunshine (astronauts rush to save the world), and Inception (weird mind-bendy pseudoscience). Interstellar fails to connect the audience to a character or create a coherent narrative the way Gravity does; in these regards, Nolan's reach exceeds his grasp. Compared to Sunshine, Interstellar fails to create a sense of tension or desperation, and fails to differentiate characters or explore their motivations. As much as I liked Interstellar's soaring moments, it has nothing to match Sunshine's death scenes. It's more comparable to Inception, but not quite as good as that. Like Inception, Interstellar is an example of trying to break the mold and tell a really earth-shattering story and failing, but Inception was at least more coherent as an action movie. But I still gave Interstellar a 7, and I'd still rather see it than much of what Hollywood puts out. In the early going of its 3 hour runtime, it's exciting when you still don't know what's about to happen. I liked Hans Zimmer's fascinatingly off-beat score, and when swells in the music met cool visuals, I was able to set aside the nonsensical plot for a minute. The score gets repetitive, and so do Michael Caine's admonitions about going gentle into the night, but I still find them moving. And I think that's my final verdict on this movie, with its moving images and nonsensical message, I'd say it's a very bad story, but a pretty good audiovisual poem.",1
283,"Run away! This is bad. It is so bad, it almost overflowed and became the best movie ever made. I'll never look at my bookshelf the same way again, knowing there's a black hole behind it. So, the people in this movie traveled to far galaxies, mastered gravity, time, and space, but still had to leave the Earth because of wheat cold, which the corn started to catch. That robot is the only thing about this movie I liked. Everything else is pure garbage. The plot, the sci fi, the length, the screenplay, special effects, all of it sucked way more than a super massive black hole. I need some protection, and hereby I'm trying to provide protection to whoever is reading. Do not watch!!!",0
284,"This movie was a big dissappointment! A ridiculous setting and a ridiculous solution, both not explained enough to be taken as seriously as the movie takes itself. Inbetween a boring waste of time with dozends of plotholes, but at least a cool little twist near the ending. The Nolans are trying so hard to do their 2001 that the only explanation I can think of for the stupid robot design is that it should remind us of the monolith!",0
286,When ever a director makes some good independent movies they give him unlimited funds to make whatever he wants.  Nolan has reached that point where they would green light pretentious junk that he writes.  Over long at 169 min  should lose the studio a large chunk of change.,0

But then a little over halfway through all of that goes out the window as one completely ridiculous scene after another unfolds itself. And what started as a believable story now has anyone with even a basic knowledge/interest in physics/astronomy cringe like their life depended on it. Even so.. Despite thinking this was going to be hard science fiction.. I don't mind fantasy being unrealistic, over the top or outright silly. After all I'm a huge Doctor Who fan. Disregarding the bad physics, the movie is still ruined by the plot holes, slow and ultimately nonsensical story progression.",0
290,there is nothing ground breaking about this movie that Star Trek didnt do first and better. the music is so load that you can not hear the actors 1/3 of the time. there is to many things that just happen thats not very realistic. example cooper is the only man for this mission but no one even bothered to look for him even though he lived a few miles away. its not like the human race is at stake or anything. the move is only average at best.,0

In fact the first half of the movie is so boring, we are unable to sit in the chairs to watch it.

The fiction is boring with lot of loose ends, Direction is very poor, you can compare a telugu movie of yester years.Indian audiance is so bored to see masala movies, with the taste of some good english science fiction movie in the recent time, this movie had completely failed its expecatation.

They spend an hour boring you at the start and then the end its: oh your daughter is about to die but we built this superspaceship thing, then cut to lonely girl on planet and you don't even see him land in his ship. What were Caines last words I couldn't even hear some of the jibberish above the music. Sorry guys this movie sucks.",0

295,"Few movies can match both the intelligence and imagination brought forth by Interstellar, which I found has everything I could ever want in a movie.  Not a moment goes by that feels overly bland or useless - quite the feat given the 2 hrs. 50 minutes total runtime.  Interstellar does carry a lot of science and theories that are used throughout the film to make sense of what is happening.  This gives a lot of creative license to Christopher Nolan, who progresses the story through creativity without ejecting audiences uncontrollably. The great thing about Nolan's approach in Interstellar is that we can't really say for sure he's right or wrong, because the movie operates on existing facts and theories in regards to space and time.  But what really anchors this movie is the sentiment of relationships - of how love is an immeasurable force that has yet to be quantified or measured in any meaningful way.  And, without using dialogue or narration, the ""5th dimension"" experience later in the movie is somewhat explained by the final seconds of the film (not a spoiler) - something I think people could have missed on a first pass.  If you loved Gravity, you're like to praise Interstellar ten-fold.",1
296,"You have to have good hearing to watch this movie. Even with my hearing aids in, I missed 70% of the conversations, which was 90% of the movie. In my view, the editor really screwed up!  So I pretty much watched it as a silent movie. That is my justification for the low score.",0
297,"The most compelling sci-fi movie in years. The emotional resonance is astounding. I cared about what was going one. I felt the pain the characters felt. I saw the underlying current of hope throughout the entire thing. It's an incredible feat to keep viewers completely hooked, interested, and entertained for almost 3 hours regardless of the form of entertainment. ""Interstellar"" does just that. By far the greatest strength the movie has is that it plays with so many complicated scientific theories at once, while simultaneously making it simple and easy to comprehend for viewers. Time-travel, black holes, worm holes, 5th dimensions, and more. The movie uses just about everything and yet outside of some particularly grand ideas right at the end I never felt even the slightest bit confused about what Nolan was getting at. This is coming from someone who has never read into any of these topics. While these scientific theories are presented in an easy to understand manner they do not lose any of their depth. That is a monumental achievement. Nolan shows us just how talented he is. He also creates one of the most gripping films I've ever seen. I give ""Interstellar"" a 9.9/10.",1
298,"I would like to start by saying I have done nothing but blow smoke up this films backside from day one. It seemed like an eternity from the first online Nolan rumblings to the cinema release, which is ironic because time doesn't actually exist! :/The wait was more than worth it thus I continue to blow smoke up this films backside. Aside from an ageing, dithering Michael Caine, the cast were, er, cast perfectly. Matthew McConaughey plays a blinder. He has kind of fallen into being typecast a little, his characters seem to be all based on late 20th Century Texan cowboys, kind of ""yee haw"" -ing and such. Not a bad thing, just saying. The emotions he projects were stunning and I fail to see why some reviews have ripped him apart for this.I understand why some reviewers don't agree with how good this film is, as its a kind of Marmite film. To some this was over the top ridiculousness that made no sense.To me it was the complete opposite. Why? - I'm yet to be able to explain it without sounding like a hippy that had been left in the desert to go mad! Fundamentally, the way it explains time and dimension hit a chord with me. I get where the film wants us to go.I have read a few articles on how the black hole Gargantua defies all current theories and that the time scales depicted when going back and forth simply do not add up - so what, its a movie, its not supposed to rewrite the four laws of thermodynamics or try to win a Nobel Prize in physics - the best it could hope for is an Oscar. And it did, just one, which makes me happy as, if it cleared up, like the hideous Gravity did, it fear it would have fallen into the commercial cheapness of film history.Thankfully, it didn't break box office records, it upset a lot of critics and it confused the **** out of most who watched it, result in my book!A grower that will have fanboys creaming themselves for years. This film will please and excite you / This film will annoy and irritate you (delete as required)10/10",1

A number of the scenes are certainly spectacular and there are plenty of clever ideas but in the end it just doesn't quite all come together like his best films, such as Memento, The Dark Knight or Inception.

This movie is the perfect example of a terrible script backed by money. The main plot is that the Earth is becoming inhabitable and humans are forced to find another planet to call their home. But what exactly is happening to Earth? There's no explanation anywhere in the movie, it's like ""hey there's some plagues attacking our crops and dust storms so we're leaving the planet"", that's all. Interstellar is full of plot holes. First, the only reason the protagonist goes to space is because some ""poltergeist"" haunting his house gave him the coordinates to NASA's facilities. By the end of the movie you'll find that the poltergeist is he in the future, in another dimension. So the whole sequence of events only happen because after it happened he could make it happen.That's nonsense. The hero enters a black hole, goes to another dimension where he could contact the past luring his old self into the space trip, and then appears near Jupiter floating all by himself and gets rescued by other humans.. A black hole is a colossal ammount of mass bound together by gravity, so strong that not even light can escape it. Anything that goes near it will be utterly destroyed. But scew science. Secondly, three people went to space, then suddenly another astronaut appears on the mission from nowhere just to die a few minutes later. Seriously, I don't understand this movie's mostly positive reviews.",0
307,"First, just to get it out of the way, yes, the science is really rather bad.  Both the ""big"" science (things like wormholes and black holes) and the ""small"" science (things like inertia and other basic physics in space).  The rest of the movie isn't bad, but it also isn't that great.  The worst part is the audio.  The movie suffers from the same problem most current movies have: far too loud music, far too quiet dialogue.When the big reveal finally happens, the BIG plot twist comes out, the dialogue is so garbled between a dying Michael Caine and a weeping Adult Murph you'll be lucky to understand one word out of 10.  And this is the most critical scene in the entire movie?  Nolan couldn't manage to get the audio people to make it understandable?When you're wishing for subtitles just so you can understand what people are saying you know the movie did a crap job on audio.They also did a terrible job on general exposition.  One third of the way through the movie and I'm having to go to Wikipedia to read up on the general plot summary so my wife and I could understand that ""Gargantua"" (really, ""Gargantua""?? Is that really what you want to name the black hole?  Is that your final answer, Nolan??) was a black hole and not the wormhole.The movie probably looked awesome in IMAX.  But... big deal.",0
308,"The premise of Interstellar is very interesting. The simple fact that we where promised astronauts travelling through a wormhole to another galaxy fascinated me with it's possibilities and it delivered big time on that front. The visual effects are some of the best I've ever seen in a SCI-FI movie, truly breathtaking. The sense of exploration and wonder was executed brilliantly.",1
309,"Huh, I come home and I find that my watch isn't working possibly. The most logical conclusion is that trans-dimensional Matthew McConaughey is sending me data on gravitational singularities in morse code... Also, wuv is a dimension. And I'm not even going to go into all the scientific **** ups they managed. Although, at the end of the day, the artistic liscense taken wasn't too glaring. This movie had a lot of missteps that ruined it for me. Matthew McConaughey came off as a registered sex offender as opposed to a loving dad. His scientist daughter reminded me of Denise Richards the nuclear scientist from ""The World is Not Enough"" only not nearly as attractive. Also Matt Damon. And he's a cowardly pragmatic. Because in Hollywood, all pragmatics=Hitler. AND STOP ****ING CRYING EVERYBODY ALL THE ****ING TIME, JESUS ****ING CHRIST. This would be a god awful movie if it weren't for some awesome cinematography. The slow piano playing to the capsule over Saturn is breathtaking. The black hole's gravitational lensing effects are stunning and from what I understand fairly accurate; two scientific papers are getting written up based on the lensing portrayed. But the soundtrack: suckedActing: suckedPlot: suckedPlot Devices (magical vegetation blight): suckedFiller (chasing a drone?): suckedCharacter development: suckedCliches: Very Good! Even managed to quickly kill the token black man.",0
310,"Enter Stella otherwise Murphy's Law of relativity for causing the wormhole people to save mankind and produce more corn. What have I just wasted over two and half hours watching? This show having the most ludicrous of explanations concerning wormholes ever possibly imagined. Throughout there was frequent references to Gravity, however there was little gravity seen, mountains in the sky. Yep those sky mountains watching that awful CGI planet, and what about the other tsunami planet, I mean come on where is the gravity? Love an emotion that is not quanitfiable. I suppose anger, fear and the rest are also lost in other singularities. The wormhole people created a wormhole in our solar system right on top of Saturn, but that planet was still in our solar system and wormhole had multiple holes?  What happened with the ejector seat, come on space debris rip his shuttle a new one, but than he ejects? No genomes were used to store any other species, like come on cows for food? No only some corny embryo's. What was up with the Indian solar drone running on solar power in flight for a decade through the dust storms, it must have nested somewhere else? The dust storms which rained down dust, near water, the river. The dust storms are spawning not next to deserts have killed all other life except for some Americans, but where are all the other insects and animals? The time remained after passing through the wormhole but departed when landing on other planets? Absolute corniness a couple of points for the TARS robots and any space craft, the only things that were worth passing this time.",0
311,"Coopers teen daughter Murph cracks the code send by a mysterious five dimensional entity with the use of gravity to reveal the location of a secret underground base that Nasa is operating in the outback of the United States.Unbeknownst to the locals Nasa has been launching covert interstellar missions in the shape of massive rockets through a wormhole that appeared of the starboard bow of Saturn. This answers a question Cooper has about where his taxes are going, for the US no longer maintains an army to gobble up the taxpayers money, which is what taxes are for apparently. Except maybe for the education which is denied to Coopers son.  He makes an excellent farmer, just like his dad, and therefore  does not need  to go to college.   You see, humanity is suffering from a rampant  food shortage and on the brink of starvation, so farmers have become very important and they do not require advanced astrophysics to till their crops.. About fifty minutes of the movie have now been used up to make it abundantly clear that the planet has been turned into  a world wide equivalent of the dust bowl and humanity is in dire straits. To make sure we will not forget the movie will get back on this time and again with scenes that are filled with massive dust clouds. Which is handy as this will certainly have saved on production costs. Now fate has it that Nasa is one astronaut short and Cooper happens to be an excellent astronaut next to being an excellent farmer, which is very convenient, especially because he happens to arrive just in time to hitch a ride. So he is duly assigned to pilot the spacecraft  that will be going through the wormhole to settle one of the twelve planets that have been discovered. Or actually one of three, for those are the ones most promising and in fact the only ones  they received data from. The tale is by now long enough  as we are a freaking 90 minutes in and this is still all to set the scene, so we going to distort time and speed up things. Just like time is distorted by the massive black hole that apparently is near all these worlds. One has humongous big waves that kills the explorer that sent the promising data that wasn't actually promising data cause it was just initial data that was repeated over and over and therefore not the data they got, but the data they did get, but didn't get in hindsight. This they  discover after they land on the planet, right between the monstrous waves and totally missing them big waves during their en-route flight and only noticing them the moment they are overwhelmed by them. Touche. Meanwhile the spacecraft  have morphed themselves into the flyers from star trek, for while they needed a massive rocket to get off earth, this is no longer required to get off the other planets.. Which is handy for it is unlikely that them planets have a hidden Nasa base with the required rockets. Although I wouldn't be surprised if they did have one. Next is an ice cold planet where Matt Damon lives, a brilliant scientist and homicidal madman who attempts to kill Cooper by having him suffocate in the not-so-benevolent atmosphere but manages only to kill the token negro by rigging his broken robot pal with explosives that are the standard equipment that Nasa sends along with their explorers(you never know what you might need to blow to smithereens). It detonates when the token negro tries to repair the bot.Incidentally Cooper merely survives suffocation by finding back his communicator, which is the size of a dollar coin and which Mad Matt has thrown into the frozen wasteland, so Cooper can call out to Anne Hathaway to come and save him. Matt meanwhile escapes with another spacecraft to the mother spacecraft, manages to damage it and kill himself in the process. Or actually the mothership ejects Matt and his spacecraft  in a violent manner thus causing it to wreck itself.  Then Cooper saves the mothership from burning up in the planets atmosphere. Are you still there? Cooper then misleads Anne to go the third and last planet where her love interest lives, while Cooper throws himself and his robot buddy into the black hole where the five dimensional entities have created a three dimensional construction that allows Cooper to communicate with his teen daughter Murph initially and then the adult version of his daughter later on  by using gravity to send her the black hole meta data back through time that allows her to save humanity from extinction. Cooper is saved from his predicament and, after having taken leave from his now granny daughter Murph,  steps in a spacecraftthat might or might not be on it's way to join Anne, who is on that other planet where her love interest has just died, so she is now available for Cooper to breed with. I expected at every moment that it would be revealed that it was all the dream of a drunken drugcrazed schizoid maniac. But it is the bloody script..",0
312,"Good movie, pretty long and in-depth and I liked the science that was used with how the space ships were docking and space travel was conducted. Graphics were great and the planets were very intuitive. Don't read past this, spoiler. I believe if you just let the story happen then it's great, but to me I just had a hard time with the timelines. He was telling himself how to start his journey while being in the future to alter his past. Well his original timeline would never have been affected by him since they would never of had found the NASA building to begin with.  I could understand if they received some kind of message from (them) and started this journey that took to long for him to be with his family, and he then altered his past in the timeline to create a new timeline that he altered since he already achieved getting to the black hole. But, like I stated earlier, if you just watch it for being a movie.. it's pretty good.",1
313,"One of the best movies I have ever seen. The music, the special effects, the story, the characters and the acting is all really, really good. And it is all based on real science. If you pay attention during the movie, you will most likely understand it.",1
314,"The film sounds interesting, but don’t be fooled: it is boring, disappointing, and very long. Such a bad cast of actors, and such a bad script! Some sort of dodgy unconvincing quantum physics documentary meets half-baked family drama.",0
316,Interstellar is a science fiction epic that challenges even 2001 with its scope and ambition; never before have I seen a film so intelligent yet dramatic to the point where I'm on the verge of tears at its conclusion.,1
319,"This is an incredible movie that can be rated above 10.  The way it displays the ongoing battle with the Left vs. Right Paradigm is stunning and how Men continue to undermine the intuition of Women and their role in facilitating and sustaining life.  It also emphasizes that men have a role in focusing on the physical hard work of life and they have a responsibility to defend and/or rescue the people and things that they cherish at all costs. This movie is the Rosetta Stone to all people who have yet to understand the meaning of love and compassion for everyone.",1
320,"First of all, I'm not really sure why people are getting over-excited about this movie - is it because of Nolan or in-depth sci-fi element in the plot. Some even say the movie is complicated which not many people can understand. From what I can gather and putting aside the sci-fi wow effect, it's all about human's survival of the fittest nature shown through each characters. That's the main drive force of the movie. Nolan put a lot of effort in making every scene count and important thus explains why the length -trust me it's still interesting though. However, the film's actual excitement is only kicking off when Cooper's journey into the black hole. Talking about Coop, Matthew's performance was top-notch. I have seen people praise on how beautiful the outer-space portrayal, I think they never seen the movie Gravity before. In the end, it's probably an almost realistic portrayal of outer-space exploration from to end to end along with some space/time theory explanation. The time relativity scene (HUGE tsunami scene) was a bomb though.",1
321,"I understand quantum physics, astronomy and particle physics. I didnt want to leave my knowledge behind when i watched this film but something made me. The film is very compelling from start to finish just like 2001. People criticise this film for its unrealistic content and yet they watch a film like 2001 and think its a classic. This Film will end up in 30 years time being regarded as the same sort of film that broke all the rules. The one thing i would say is that the mumbling annoyed me at first but the more i watched the more i cared less about it. Again parallels between 2001s lack of speech and this movies ""mumbling"" can be made. Baring The Dark Knight (and this is disputable) this film is by far the best film the director has made!",1
324,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and is even better once you watch it a second time round.Do yourself a favor and watch it more than once.",1
325,"Half good, half American - good ol' American farmboy is all things to all people and saves the world, an excess of American flags flying in far away galaxies, American myths propagated (like the claim that broad altruism hasn't yet evolved, then displaying it to show how 'transcendent' they are), and American tropes abused (wise cracking robot sidekick - does everything have to be comedy?). Reminded me vaguely of the first season of Farscape (which was pretty good). There was another good hour or two left in the story that I would have liked to see, maybe they'll make a few sequels. They left out an explanation of the blight... because no explanation could make sense and tie together the narratives they are selling. ""6 billion people consumed too much"" can't explain every last person dying or the mysterious plant contagion. Humanity would eat bacteria grown under nuclear light if it came to it. And what's with the coughing? - dust masks are cheap. It's cinematic hand-waving trying to show general malaise because they chose not to provide a coherent back story. And I was annoyed by our supposedly smart hero asking, what should be for him, stupid questions to give the movie an excuse to explain things to the lay-viewer, surely that could have been done less conspicuously. As much as I liked this movie, sadly it's more ""American spirit conquers science"" than science fiction. I was going to call it ""love conquers science"" but you don't even really feel the love like in Frequency (another good ""love conquers reality"" kind of movie). I'm sad that Hollywood has made yet another supernatural action-comedy masquerading as science fiction. And shouldn't I have been surprised by the father being the 'ghost'? Isn't that how this kind of thing is suppose to work? Or do they foreshadow the twists so the viewer feels smart when they figure it out? And a happy ending was never in doubt... right from the beginning you knew they are going to 'deus ex machina' their way to victory... barely any tension at all. Really the only good parts were the parts where you thought the movie was about to get interesting (but never did) - when it was offer false anticipation of being a good movie, like the ending. And yet grading it on a curve, I give it 8/10.",1
326,"Not Nolan's best movie, but it's a great journey. The story and ideas are pretty sophisticated as usual, but I didn't find them too far-fetched or too hard to follow. The visuals are incredible, its easy to see why this got the Oscar nomination for visual effects. It's one of those movies that needs to be seen twice since you'll leave the theater the first time with some questions. The main focus of this movie is ambition, both behind the camera and on the screen, and it pays off.",1
327,"Sit back, grab a coke and some popcorn, because you're not going anywhere for three hours. Is Interstellar a prefect film? no, and for three hours I wished it developed certain relationships out more, but it finds a way to keep you interest long enough to get you through to the big reveal that comes at you unexpectedly like a shot of fireball to the face, leaving you wanting a little bit more, but it's 2AM and the bar's cut you off.",1
328,"Excellent sci-fi movie, but the science isn't as great as most think. It has many flaws, but the movie shines especially in the emotional part and the dramatic plot.",1
329,"Interstellar is cinematic masterpiece, Christopher Nolen proves time and time again why he is a cinematic god from epic films like Dark Knight Trilogy and this film I'm reviewing today because of its strong story of family, concurring the impossible and a jaw dropping adventure, and you know what, the film looks and sounds awesome, not joking this film is one of the best films I've seen in 2014 and space the rockets look so good and the sounds in this film are so natural because if you imagine a rocket taking off or a storm erupting, your going to be BLOWN AWAY because that how you would imagine it would sound like. The films story is set in a futuristic Earth, and our main protagonist is Copper, a former space pilot, now farmer and family man has to deal with the hardship of how Earth is becoming unstable to live in and he has to be sent to space to find a new home to save the excising humanity on a dying planet, but with that in mind he has to leave his family on Earth, especially his daughter Murph who since she's the youngest she is getting all emotional about her dad leaving, but what so awesome about this film is how Cooper s racing against time to get back to his kids because time will slow down for him while in space and there is a horror him missing his kids lives and they'll be getting older while he's still in space. Casting was done really well and Matthew McConaughey is brilliant as Copper, he delivers  in every single way for his role, and Jessica Chastain is amazing, I can just watch her and her alone in a film and I'd still be entertained, but there were a few characters I didn't have any interest in but even they had their moments. Christopher Nolen definitely has changed cinematic history with the amazing visuals, it's absolutely amazing of how far we can go in film making. Interstellar is defiantly a must see film, if it's gone from your local cinema I'd defiantly recommend it on Blu-Ray because it's so good and I most certainly will, however it is a 3hr film but it's well worth it. If you go to see Interstellar, be prepared to not only see a great film but experience an awesome adventure.",1
330,Cool? It don't really know what to say about the film. People say it has a lot of Inception related things and the director seems to know what he's doing,1
331,"A story of despair in an age of hope, told through the medium of mumbled dialog and extremely poor decision making. The plot after the first act makes absolutely no sense and is content to meander aimlessly for the thick end on 3 hours. The science is very very poor, the visuals are good but never impressive, and the only redeeming features are a pair of sarcastic black-veneered robotic TV stands.",0
332,"A film that viciously defends the art of filmmaking, and embraces it wholeheartedly. Brings wonder and adventure back to cinema. The experience itself is genuinely moving, and the film is as thoughtful, potent, and visually stunning as anything Nolan has ever made. Perhaps more so.",1
333,"Nolan forced me to write my opinion here by ""Interstellar"" ..I can say it was Wonderful .. & so Amazing ..I am in awe and amazement yet ..""Interstellar"" was so perfect !!it has everything .. tear , smile , Hopelessness , hope , fear , love , Faith , . . . and science flowed across the film ...",1
335,"If its your first sci-fi film and surely its an outstanding film with a great concept and if its your first Christopher Nolan movie then you will call go all crazy about the Nolan  making him a guy from another universe! But lets make the facts right :1. Steven Spielberg is the best modern-age sci-fi director2.Music was too loud unlike Zimmer3. scientific facts were wrong most of the time which was the key element as what he  promised4. For me execution was  perfect as the budget goes it should be .5. same style of filming again and again Ok. Memento , The Dark Knight and Inception are the only three great movies from  Christopher Nolan's team not INTERSTELLAR",1
336,"I'm not entirely sure what movie all the people who gave good reviews watched but it certainly wasn't the Interstellar I saw. This is the advice I gave my friends about it: Please friends, whatever you do this year take $12 and go see Interstellar....it's worth that much money to see what is probably the biggest, longest, most expensive, piece of **** science fiction movie ever made at this point in history.The story while initially intriguing has such poor structure, dialog, lack of character and relationship development coupled with so much nonchalant coincidence and plot holes bigger than the miraculous black hole the hero falls into that by the end I was hoping all of the characters would fail and humanity would come to it's richly deserved end. I will not boor you with the details (if you want boring just go see the ponderous thing) and just say that the 2 hours and 55 minutes of Interstellar was the biggest waste of time of my year so far. What a tremendous waste of time, energy, resources and acting talent.",0
337,"I was extremely disappointed by this movie.  I felt it was pretentious, imitative, overlong, and predicated on meaningless pseudoscientific gibberish.  Matthew McConaughey delivers most of his lines in an almost inaudible near-whisper for no apparent reason. Some movies pay respectful homage to their predecessors, but this movie seems to have consciously set as its goal to out-2001 ""2001, A Space Odyssey"", as well as several other sci-fi goodies. Unfortunately, 2001 was based on a loftier artistic concept than merely trying to outdo a predecessor and so has a huge advantage out of the starting gate. The soundtrack I found especially annoying due to extreme overuse of the ""hey folks, this is the awesome moment of grandeur you've been waiting for"" emotion which it attempted to invoke about every three minutes and as a result made it impossible to detect when, if ever, a moment of true grandeur and awe might actually have occurred.   Numerous moments in the movie were clearly designed to extract that emotion from gullible moviegoers but for me they were unconvincing. Special effects are for the most part very good and there were some enjoyable and exciting moments when I wasn't thinking about the silly context they took place in.  Certainly not worth the three hour time and money investment.",0
341,"This is as close to perfection as its going to get for a sci-fi. Excellent ideas and inspiration combined with good plot and characters. They may not be new and unheard of but they were good and put together well. The round colony design concept was seen in the japanese anime series Gundam starting more than 10 years ago. All in all the best Sci-fi film I have ever seen. There are too few sci-fi these days let alone decent ones.",1
342,"No, it was not overly complicated. No, it was not amazing. It just had nothing to communicate. It was like inception; it had some ideas, that looked promising on the surface, but they was just a sweet coating for... Yes, nothing. A thin story about love, transcending time and space, as sweet as any Hollywood blockbuster, but nothing real. I had high expectations, I do not know why. That Nolan just keeps disappointing.",0
346,"Why the hell does every goddamn Christopher Nolan movie create so much hype? This movie was okay, albeit slightly below average for a decent science fiction. The plot was simple. With numerous examples of bad execution. A far advanced civilization stemming from humanity, communicates with the past to save humanity. There is a chosen person who is guided to discover the theory which will save us all. Sounds cliched right? Sometimes simple plots like this can make powerful impact... if told well. This movie however, makes you wonder what was the point of such an elaborate manipulation scheme - involving wormholes pointing towards 12 potentially habitable worlds etc... - if the objective was just to deliver a scientific theory to humans. Surely if a technology can create wormholes, and create constructs inside a black hole to reach little girl's bookshelf (haha), and teleport a man from within a black hole to a space station - they will have the means to just communicate the theory? (The entire communication being so small that a person can manually type it in morse code??) Apparently not. The movie also appeared very low budget. The robot looked pathetically B-Grade... as if from an old 1960's movie. I am not kidding - it is voiced by a human - without any attempt to mechanize it in either dialog or tone. One would think robots are so far advanced, that speechwise they are absolutely indistinguishable from an average human being.But, the sophistication convenitnetly ends there - the robot is such a clumsy hulk that you ponder if it can even walk properly. Let alone carry out sophisticated space-ship robot business. Cheap. 1960's. Other flaws - you find a planet where there's water everywhere - and waves are gargantuan (pun intended if you see the movie), and the water is only ankle deep??? Very convenient eh?In another earth-like planet - you have frozen solid clouds hovering in the air. Typical Nolan, just making whatever came to his mind. And in not a very satisfying way. The best scene of the movie (according to me) is the one with the gargantuan wave. Unfortunately that too was quite underwhelming. You don't get to see what really happened as the wave passes... some turmoil within the ship, and then camera rolls outside with the wave safely passed and everything is calm. Either the directors didn't have the imagination or the budget to film it the way it should have been done. It did have a few nice moments though - which made me chuckle, the dialog on customization of a robot for example -Robot: Any other customization?Cooper: Yes, set humor to 75%.Robot: Auto destruct in T minus 10, 9, 8,...Cooper: Alright. 60%. Anyway. I can name a number of science fiction movies with better plot and scientific accuracy than this. Speaking of scientific accuracy - the only plot point that's even worth mentioning was that time slows down under stress of gravity... and wormhole. Neither is new. Eemployed already in hundreds of movies and television series. Some more inaccuracies -1. While falling in a ""gentle"" black hole, Cooper's transmission would not simply break into static, it should gradually become further and further stretched like a sound played in slow motion.2. A planet orbiting a supermassive black hole will be dark - unless the black hole is part of a binary system and the other star is still alive. The black hole in the movie was illuminated by a disk which cannot exist. It looked more like an artist's (inaccurate) imagination than how a black hole should really be like - black.3. While traveling in the wormhole, the wall won't wobble, which you can touch. If it came to a wobble - that means gravitational stress is already so high that it's bending light - much earlier than that your space-ship will be crushed and you'd be dead.4. The moment you escape gravitational pull of a planet _stably_ orbiting a black hole, you wouldn't be in immediate danger of getting sucked into the black hole. Even light should take hours (if not months and years) to fall into the black hole.Boy... for a movie where nothing really happens in the entire first half - things are really sped up in wrong times. The grandeur and of space sacrificed, realism be damned, astronomical distance of space be damned, to instead offer the thrill of ""OMG we escaped the planet but we are now falling into a black hole!""5. Construction inside a black hole that allows you to access a girl's bookshelf. Hahahaha At this point you cannot take the movie seriously anymore Looks like the plot is just as B-Grade as certain things in the movie. I feel obligated to point out inaccuracies since this is being hyped as scientifically accurate. I am not even including incaccuracies in spoken dialog by science professionals in the movie. Even ""Gravity"" had far fewer inaccuracies - and is by the way, it is an excellent movie to watch. Apparentl",0
347,"I saw Interstellar with really high expectations because 2 of my friends said it was amazing. They were right! The movie opens up with a segment about earth. It has basically turned to s*** and there are dust storms frequently. Not to mention the lack of crops and wildlife. Basically, as said by Michael Caine, ""Your daughter's generation will be the last on earth."" Not a good sign. So Michael Caine's character asks Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) to take a long and dangerous journey into space in the hopes of saving the human race. The original plan was to bring everyone off of Earth and repopulate on another world. But that plan, as revealed in the movie, is not possible. So they are forced to go with plan B, which was to abandon everyone on earth and start a new colony with their frozen human embryos on their ship. But before that part of the story, they visit two planets. A water planet and an ice planet. The water planet is made entirely of shallow water and occasionally has cloud-high waves that sweep the planet and eliminate any life that may be in that area. So... Not the best place to setup a human colony because the original scientist who landed there was most likely hit by one of those waves as well as Cooper's third crew member. The second planet they visit is entirely made of ice and is very visually appealing to the eye. There, they meet another scientist who seemed so grateful to be freed. But, he turns out to be a selfish man because he abandons Cooper's crew and attempts to dock on their spaceship. He failed however, and wrecked their ship in the process. But Cooper manages to escape the planted with Anne Hathaway and manages to dock on the wrecked spaceship. But seeing that all hope is lost, he decides to take a chance and uses the black hole's force to propel her from the ship, but only her. He proceeds to enter the black hole and enters the time dimension where time is instead physical instead of figurative. From there he manages to send a message on his daughter's watch and they figure it out. He then escapes the time dimension and is luckily found by a team of searchers by Saturn. He then finds himself at Cooper station (named after his daughter) which orbits Saturn. He then gets a chance to see his daughter one last time, who is now at least 40 years older than him. Interstellar does have a very sad ending which made me tear up I have to admit. But overall, Interstellar is a compelling Sci-Fi movie with great performances, especially by Matthew McConaughey. 9/10 (Awesome)",1
348,"Interstellar might not be Christopher Nolan's best effort... but it still is one of THE MOST exhilarating and emotional cinematic experiences i have ever had in the theater. Technically speaking, the film is close to perfect, from the editing, the cinematography, the sound mixing and the visual effects. But surely enough, the acting, the screenplay, and specially, the directing, are all top notch. I know many people found this movie to be boring, long winded, pretentious and nonsensical, but i found it profound, edgy, heartbreaking and breathtaking. The best film of 2014, by far",1
350,"This can a be a very complex movie to understand and it's not a crowd pleaser like Inception or The Dark Knight Trilogy but Christopher Nolan did another incredible thing. Interstellar challenges not only the world we live in but also the galaxy and Science. The director went quite beyond this time, beyond even the knowledge people have nowadays and pictured a believable future and things that could actually happen and exist. Besides, it does a pretty intense discussion about family and human relationships. Although Caine's aging was weird and Affleck was very disposable in the story, Interstellar works and it works a lot. If it's not appreciated they way it deserves nowadays, in the future it will. Way to go Nolan!",1
351,"Filme épico de ficção científica! Excelente direção, efeitos especiais, trilha sonora, fotografia, roteiro... filme fechado 100%, com uma história bem envolvente e com um ritmo muito bom que te faz pensar em várias situações que são apresentadas no decorrer do filme. Explorar alguns dos conceitos mais ""hardcores"" da ficção científica como viagens espaciais interestelares, viagem no tempo, buraco de minhoca (espacial) e etc. As referências e homenagens a '2001' ficam bem claras e as comparações, em várias passagens, são inevitáveis. Entretanto, não se trata de uma cópia barata e sim de um grande filme com a mesma linha do '2001'. Com certeza não é o tipo de filme que vai agradar a todos, entretanto, se você é fã de ficção científica, se você assim como eu considera '2001: Uma Odisseia no Espaço' um dos melhores filmes da história do cinema, ou se você simplesmente gosta de apreciar uma grande produção, um excelente filme muito bem feito, eu indico 100% esse filme!!! Se não o melhor, com  certeza, um dos melhores filmes de 2014!!",1
352,"Somewhere on the path to juxtaposing the story of the imminent death by starvation of humanity on Earth against a desperate search for a new planetary home (hopefully to not similarly despoil), the authors of ""Interstellar"" forgot to consider the audience and instead created a far too long, far too arcane and far too pet film. ""Interstellar"" is a kissin' cousin to the equally pet, pseudo mind-blowing, con man sleight-of-hand ""Inception."" A bitter taste is left in the mouth by a self-satisfied script constantly trumpeting a specialness that, alas, is not at all special. Audiences have been beat to death by the tropes, plot elements and dialogue seen so many times before. For example, the ""Pursued By Demons Retired ______ Forced Back Into Service"" trope. Women, as in most films, are relegated to the back of the bus. When will writers and filmmakers wake up to the richness in woman's hearts and minds - even a cold scientist's ticker and noggin? Face-down-death awaits the character with the fewest lines and closeup. (Much like the Bic 'Red Shirts' in ""Star Trek"" you knew would never make it to the end credits.) An intelligent young woman becomes hysterical because Daddy's leaving, yet her intellect does not grasp his mission is important: To save her and the rest of the world. Beside, Daddy didn't explain, at least not on camera. Matt Damon resurrects from hypersleep to wreak havoc as in the hackneyed ""Don't Astronauts on ""The Twilight Zone"" Pass Basic Psych Tests?"" plot element. Don't forget the Dead Wife and Wise Grandpa tropes. Wonder is non-existent. That's quite a feat as few films have led us through a wormhole. ""Black Hole"" did a better job. At least the mysterious passage in Disney's opus didn't suggest injection into a globule borrowed from the coda of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" (Also cobbed from Kubrick's masterpiece are the more human than humans (articulated) computers.) Cinematic corn served warm with a schmear of butter is quite delicious. Corn served cold by trying-too-hard actors sittin' on the porch waxin' philosophical is a dish best passed to the person sitting on your right. There are nonsensical interviews of dust storm survivors who describe what the special effects department has just shown. There's no lack of understanding why the run time is 169 minutes. The dogged determination to not self-edit and lose script pages underscores either Nolan's lack of being a good audience or not caring about audiences - the latter a quality indicative of too many contemporary filmmakers. The ending leads to head scratching that, in another film, would elicit laughs from the audience. Poltergeists my patootie! ""Interstellar"" veers uncomfortably close to complete train wreck, but there are a few nice touches. While derivative, the articulated computers are cool. That mankind can solve mankind's problems without an advanced alien intelligence, God or other deus ex machina is the one original idea - and it's a good one. Save very few elements to recommend it, ""Interstellar"" is a really, really long bore pretending importance. There's nothing worse than films of that ilk.",0
354,This movie was a cinema masterpiece why? because of its engaging story the emotion you feel as you are sitting in your seat the actors great performances and a director that knows what he is doing is there anything wrong with the movie? Plot holes but its not enough to be terrible,1
355,I do believe this movie does have many shortcomings in the ways of character development and overuse of special effects but it doesn't take away the epic feel of this Sci Fi movie. I disagree that it is Nolan's worst efforts to the big screen but it certainly isn't the best.,1
356,"Interstellar features the sloping surfaces of Inception, philosophy of space odyssey, realism and visuals of Gravity, and the surviving battle of Apollo 13, all in one amazing spectacle.",1
357,"I generally enjoy Christopher Nolan films, even if at times I think he gets a little carried away with esoteric ideas for his own good. Sadly Interstellar is one of those films where his grand ideas have run out of control and there was no-one around to tell Nolan to pull his head in. As a result Interstellar is pretentious, waffling, self-indulgent load of pseudo-artistic bulldust that left me infuriated and wishing I could get my money and my two hours back. I rarely give very low scores for things, because most have some positive qualities, but the negatives of Interstellar were so infuriating that I can't let it slide.",0
358,"The First Half of the Film is Nice and Mind Blowing. Director Even used a Scientist to get accurate Scientific ""Scenes and Scripts"". But one thing I hate the most is ""HOW COME McCONAUGHEY NOT TORE APART WHEN HE ENTERS THE GARGANTUA BLACKHOLE AND HOW COME THE LIBRARY IN HIS HOUSE WAS IN THERE .?. IF ROMILY WAITED 23 YEARS THEN HOW LONG Dr. MANN WAITED?.."" This film is but a deceptional hit.",0
359,The movie has lived up to its hype in my eyes.It took a little while to get going but it got intresting fairly quick.It does have its little flaws but still definitely worth a 9.,1
360,"I had high hopes for this film, and as the end credits rolled I was not dissapointed.   This films core focus is 'is humanity able to cope psychologically' when exposed to such powerful time bending forces of relativity.The SFX are pretty epic, and you get a real sense of being with them on their voyage through time and space.The ending is great, and ties the entire film together, I appreciate a lot of people say its far fetched, but its quite plausible and very forward thinking in theory, it will open your mind.My only minor criticism would be, for me, that the film is a little too emotional with regards to coop and his family (yes i was hiding the fact i was quite choked at the cinema through various scenes) but I guess that was the films core premise.  Bravo to all involved.  You will walk away knowing whats more important in life.",1
361,"The best movie that has ever come. This movie is made by consulting the best theoretical physicists. So blaming it for unbelievable scientific scenes is **** Only a mentally retarded person can say it is a useless movie. The ultimate struggle for unconditional love, Love is beyond all dimensions, that is what Nolan meant. A true masterpiece!!",1
362,"No doubt visually stunning and addresses an important issue we may face in the near film. Along with a stunning soundtrack and a moving plot line makes this film great. However what prevents it from being a masterpiece is the unnecessary length along with this film being covered in Nolan's fingerprints. Interstellar suffers some of these amen issues that Inception did with large points implied however the film can't grasp the full concept. Nolan tries his best to avoid exposition, but its inevitable. Some of his  characters were stale and seemingly there to just explain important plot points. Despite that however, I found this to be a very entertaining film, keeping me on the edge of my seat nearly the entire show.",1
363,Well... a new GREAT Christopher Nolan masterpiece !!! everything you see in the movie is AWESOME !!! from the storytelling to music and the special effects. it's the 168 MIN in your life that you'll never forget.,1
364,"Really liked this great movie Matthew McConaughey just gets better and better! The idea itself is a little scary, but thought it was beautifully filmed, all the actors compliment each other wonderfully.",1
365,"This is a really weird movie, and while that's not a bad thing, it can get really confusing. The concept is easy to understand, but the plot can get a little garbled in all the action. I wouldn't buy it, but if one of my friends had it on DVD or Amazon Prime one night for movie night, I'd watch it again.",1
366,"Dr. Brand: ""Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light"". The story is about a team of explorers undertakes the most important mission in human history; traveling beyond this galaxy to discover whether mankind has a future among the stars. Christopher Nolan once said that 2001: A space odyssey was his all time favorite film and he wanted to do a small tribute to his work in Nolan's next film, and then comes Interstellar a movie that will put a smile on Kubrick face if he was alive today, because Interstellar is one of the best movie of 2014 and the best movie experience. I saw this movie in IMAX and all through out this film I felt like I was in space floating around with Mconaughey and Anne Hathaway. I had that feeling that I was going deep into space just like are main character's, going deep into space just like the viewing auditions and me. The visual effect's in this movie are some of the most stunning, beautiful and Jaw dropping effect's I've seen since well 2001: A Space Odyssey. The performances were brilliant, The cinematography was breathtaking and hard to look away. The directing by Christopher Nolan and let me get this out there, this man is a true director; he knows cinema and knows how to interested people into seeing he's films and I'm still shocked that he hasn't won a Oscar for that. Now most people or critics have said that last third of this movie ruined the movie for them, but I actually like the ending to the movie, it's new for Nolan because he always ends on a deep and cold note, but this movie didn't and I didn't mind it. My only nick pick with the movie is some of the character's in this movie wasn't all that interesting. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are the only character's that to me were interesting and I cared for them, but the rest of the character's I didn't really care for. Overall Interstellar is a mind-blowing movie with fantastic visual's with a interesting story line that will keep you interested.",1
367,"It shows really brilliant visual effects but I'm not sure it is gripping film. Nevertheless, If you want to see this movie, I recommend it. Visual effect",1
368,Matthew does a decent job with his role .... somewhat of a far out story but then again it's science fiction. I think some users rated it a tad too high because of the lack of competition when film was released..  All and all I've seen better and I've seen much worse. Still enjoyable & worth the price of admission,1
369,this movie is what i was waiting for a long time!!hope soon they touch the subject of the 10th dimension and further more .. after inception this one is an instant Classic for me ! Hands DOWN,1
370,"Interstellar is an intelligent film, filled with emotion and twists. Terrific achievement by Chris Nolan, both with the script and on the director's seat. The acting is also top notch. However IT IS LOOONG! Even though the 3rd act of the story is terrific, and the highlight of the film - one struggles to concentrate, as it goes on FOREVER. And lastly, I would've liked to see a lot more people. 'People' are the subject at hand in this feature film. Congratulations to Mr Nolan on a strong effort.",1
371,"film juste magnifique , ou l'on comprend que la clé de l'histoire est l'amour du père et de sa fille , des scène superbe , des robot hyper classe , enfin un film qui fait honneur a la science fiction",1
372,"Great scenery, great story development and great special effects.There are some holes in the plot, but nothing to keep you away from enjoying this movie.I strongly recommend watching this movie on a bigger screen and good sound system.",1
373,"Thats how you make movies ... great storyboard, great actors, great storytelling. People should stop taking movies to seriously, and try to tell people whats wrong with this and that ... seems like most people know more physics than Kip Thorne.",1
374,"Interstellar is not only an ambitious attempt at exploring the unknown universes and galaxies and the unfathomable existence of lifeforms and planets beyond our own, its also an exploration into the potential emotional development that comes with such adventures. the acting was solid even though the storyline feels a bit muffled at the end.",1
375,"Interstellar is one of Christopher Nolan's best films it is a gripping and intriguing look at space exploration with breathtaking special effects and cinematography, the characters are well thought out and likable, the story is of course very good but can get a little fractured at times the ending also doesn't really have the emotional punch i was looking for but none the less interstellar is fantastic.",1
376,Christopher Nolan's best film IMO. People talk about The Prestige and TDK and Memento and I love them all but this one is the best for me. This is also one of the most underrated films out there possibly because of it's hard to understand ending. The sound and imagery of this film is astounding and powerful. You likely won't understand it all the first time of watching or even the second.. but the more times you watch this the more it leaves you thinking afterwards. 5 star film for me!,1
378,"""Interstellar"" was by far the most anticipated movie in my recent existence so it had a lot of great expectations to meet. Fortunately, this film did not disappoint, if anything, it left me wanting more.",1
379,"WHAT I LIKED: The core achievement of this ambitious film truly is that it grips you with despair in each moment. This is thanks to some extremely touching character development that Nolan manages to protray perfectly (with help from some great acting.) It ticks the emotional engagement box just as well as it ticks the spectacle box too, because 'Interstellar' is visually stunning, and features yet another incredible Zimmer soundtrack. Also, as per Nolan, we get some extremely thought provoking themes explored, and this time it's truly mind-bendingWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Mind-bending it is, because the physics and concepts in this film are very hard to get your head around, and that does come slightly at the expense of an understandable narrative yet again.VERDICT: Interstellar is incredible, and each moment is very gripping and engaging. It will leave you feeling thrilled and amazed, if slightly confused too.",1
380,"Cringe-worthy, in so many ways.  But it really comes down to one biggest problem: Plot holes. Before Interstellar, I didn't fully understand what a ""plot hole"" was, I'll admit.  One viewing is enough to educate anyone on what plot holes are simply because they're so rampant. There's some decent acting, and some decent effects, but it's not enough.",0
382,"This was legendary. Greatest movie i have ever seen. From the actors to the visuals and the music, everything was just flawless. A MUST SEE.",1
383,Epic. Gorgeous. Thought Provoking. Music is immensely moving. Theme song will is my ringtone.,1
385,"While the ending of this film is incredibly stupid, everything else in Interstellar works perfectly.",1
386,"Worst audio mixing in the history of movies. I gave up instantly and didn't even watch the movie. It could be a great movie, who knows, but this ""bold and adventurous"" move ruined it for me.",0
387,"이 영화를 이해하지 못해서인지, 나에게 크게 다가오지 못했다. 크리스토퍼 놀란 감독을 좋아하긴 하지만, 컷던 기대에 못미치는 영화였다.",1
389,Maybe it’s because I’m a nerd but I really enjoyed this movie. It has flaws (mainly the end) but overall a great movie.,1
392,"Made a special effort to drive the distance to see this movie as my home town was not showing it.  Glad I did!   A powerful film, heartwrenching and like a good wine, it got better with time.  Loved the robots, loved the music.  See it.",1
393,I gave it a 7 as I thought it was OK. I like 47 Ronin better. Critics probably like it because they think that our Earth is heading in this direction. I didn't think about it much after I finished watching it so it wasn't that great for me.,1
394,"A remarkable achievement, its has everything from drama to intense and even to horrifying as well as awe moments. I enjoyed every second of it, even though it represents itself as scientifically correct, the thing that impresses me that it works as a film / movie and all in all an experience that its really hard to find in other movies or even compare it to others. My only regret is that I finally was able to watch it on Netflix in my home and not on theatres as it should be.",1
395,"Solid sci-fi film, but I didn't think it as mind-blowing as many reviews say. The drama felt a bit forced, and personally the robots were my favorite characters. Great soundtrack.",1
396,"Definitely one of the best, if not the best movie, to come out in 2014. Spectacular. Cinematography, sound design, VFX, acting -- all on point. It is definitely one of the most challenging movies to watch, but not for any of the cheap/cliché reasons being exploited in Hollywood. It's challenging because the content and information itself is so abstract, and forces the audience member to evolve their own understanding of how the universe and physics work in order to comprehend the plot. The only, ""gimme,"" is the wormhole--but beyond that, there's not really any hand-holding. No, instead Nolan wants you to watch and re-watch this film over and over, research astrophysics and time-space on your own, and secure as firm of grasp on these concepts as possible. And you better hold on tight once you do, because this movie is one hell of a ride.",1
397,"Spirited humanism at it's best!  It's been years since I was so inspired by a film. There are flaws, but the experience is fantastic. Who's to say what the human race is capable of, or what existential threats we may face? Possibilities are endless.",1
398,"Interstellar is slightly disappointing for a Nolan film with a problematic story, but is still a very good film.",1
399,Interstellar is an amazing Sci-Fi movie. Aside from its slow start - the movie ends up in space most of the storyline. An amazing cast of characters and storyline moments with a fantastic sound track from Hans Zimmer himself - this makes one of the best movies Nolan has made. Like the Inception the feels and the plot really makes a audience member connect with the characters.,1
400,"Interstellar is your typical Christopher Nolan film. It has an incredible score that plays throughout essentially the entire movie, beautiful visuals, an interesting and captivating plot, great acting, great character and setting development, a heavy reliance on suspended disbelief, and enormously huge plot holes. Some people don't mind them but I have trouble with plot holes so big that they actively go against what has already been established in the story arc. Forewarning, the following sentences will contain SPOILERS that are as big as the plot holes they discuss. Now I won't get into the details on every single little plot hole and inconsistency because this review would become way too long. I will, however, touch on the two biggest ones, in my opinion, and both have to do with the conclusion of the movie so again, you've been warned. The first is the complete and total fail that is the time paradox proposed in this film, more specifically the 'bootstrap' paradox. This is based on the concept that critical content that the futures hinges on is actually acquired from the future itself. Of course, this theory is a farce but unfortunately many science fiction stories rely on it as its foundation. Theoretical physicists will disagree but they're just manufacturing job security (i.e. they're liars). I won't go into too much detail on the various examples of this paradox in the film but if you see it, it'll be painfully obvious which instances I'm referring to, as they point them out for you. The second fail is the inconsistency of time relativity, as they introduce it in the movie itself. It makes sense throughout most of the film... until the end, when Anne Hathaway somehow doesn't age. Nolan apologists will fabricate arguments to defend this or make excuses, just like they did in Inception, but the reality is that Nolan blew it here. She should've aged 51 years or more just like the rest of the people (outside of Matthew McConaughey, who was sucked into a black hole and of course survived). I mainly focused on the negatives with this review because those few negatives are what held the movie back from a perfect rating. If Nolan would've gotten out of his own way, this could've been one of my favorite science fiction films ever. Unfortunately, it was pushed back to the ""really good but not great"" category where so many other films reside.",1
402,"I have yet to see a Christopher Nolan movie I didn't love (probably because I haven't seen Man of Steel) and Interstellar didn't disappoint. It is clever, gripping, progressive and features a number of excellent performances. There did seem to be a few holes in the plot, but I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt to Nolan and assume I missed something. If that is true, though, then it could have been a bit clearer at times.",1
403,"Maybe because the ending was spoiled for me I couldn't give it a 10, but I did enjoy seen a movie that was mostly accurate scientifically.  It was a really great movie, I look forward to seeing it again.",1
404,"Loved it. Excellent music score. Interesting plot and world, some aspects of which are quite realistic and could potentially occur in the future. Great characters with real relationships and developments. Very moving, emotional, and intellectual - particularly in getting much of the science right. Definitely lived up to the hype and is worth watching. Beautiful cinematography and of course superb special effects.",1
406,"Fascinating film. One of those few blockbusters that still manage to be intelligent, have depth and be original (in this world full of sequels and prequels). So glad that a film like this one can still blow at the box office. The almost three hours feel like one and a half and is one of the biggest cinematic experiences of the last few years and probably the best space film ever made. The story and its ambition, the score (Hans Zimmer once again), the visuals, the emotional content, the acting... everything! Yes Matthew and also Anne and Jessica Chastain deliver better performances than some of the ones nominated for an oscar this year.It is a pleasure to know that people like director C. Nolan still exist and people are still willing to support it massively in a world where Transformers, Fast and Furious and Avengers can make so much money. Congrats to everybody. I could barely sleep the night I saw it because of how it made my imagination fly and how fascinated I was. Many jaw-dropping moments too. A 9.5 out of 10 from me.",1
407,"Make no mistake.  Interstellar is an amazing, emotionally resonant, and thought provoking movie.  I just didn't find it as perfect as the first time I watched it.  The acting is all Oscar worthy.  The great cast performs all of the deeply emotional moments with absolute perfection.  You may definitely cry.  This is also one of the most visually stunning movies ever made, containing breathtaking sequences of pure awe and wonder, the best of which is a cerebral and heartbreaking trip into a black hole near the end, but I'm not going to spoil anything for you.  Upon my second viewing however, I realized that there could have been a couple more of these types of moments placed into certain parts of the film.  The drama is all very well executed, but sometimes the movie does go a little too long without any action.  But this is still a film that hits you on much deeper levels than any action scene ever could.  Its ambition, imagination, and humanity are nearly unmatched.  It's also one of the few blockbusters that actually ends on a high, make that extremely, high note.  A sci-fi movie for the ages.",1
408,"Great movie - definitely one worth investing nearly 3 hours of your time to. I'd have to say that the emotional music, gripping music, and cool effects implemented all have had an effect on making this movie a 9/10 level movie. Well done Mr. Nolan!",1
410,"Interstellar certainly does travel far, far far beyond an intellectual level possibly, maybe to far to be believable so far that it can hit some SCFI elements? It seems to me that was how Chris wanted Interstellar to be, as grounded as possible, in my opinion only for the believable emotional acting chops of Matthew McConaughey and strong supporting cast I don't know if interstellar would been as believable though there are a few faults. I admire Christopher Nolan's vision and possible message? he has set throughout Interstellar, and of course Hans Zimmer's score perfects the sense of being in space and the chilling atmosphere that comes with it. For the best experience see the movie in IMAX the way Chris wanted it to be seen it certainly is a trip.",1
411,"Una razón más para confirmar que Nolan se ha hecho experto en películas blowmind, nunca creería leer algo de física cuántica hasta que vi este viaje intergaláctico lleno de emotividad.",1
412,"A true hommage to sci-fi classics such as Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Tarkovsky's Solyaris and very good Cuaron's Gravity. Very ambitious movie, ''shooting for the stars'', although sometimes loses itself in the making but nevertheless impressive work of art. A must see on the big screen whenever you'll like it or hate it. It deserves it.",1
413,"Great movie. People that criticise the conclusion of the movie about the ""power of love"" stuff are unable to understand a simple message the story try to pass for the people that are watching the movie. It's so simple that I find it impressive how they even dare to use it as a negative point in the movie ha ha. Let's try to help these fellas understand: the movie is not just about the looks or about the future of humanity or technology or science. The movie is about the human nature and the stuff that really matters in the end. See? It's simple... People who complain about that was expecting a star wars movie or something else. Their frustration doesn't reflect the reality about the quality of the movie.",1
414,"One of the best Sci-fi movies of all-time. Chris Nolan is using science in the best imaginative ways possible to create a complex , beautiful and transcendent  look at our universe and our existence.And how would we survive in the face of extension. The movie is influenced greatly by 2001: A Space Odyssey in the scope of its enormous ambition but it's also very original in its plot .It literally invades secret new locations of the universe no one has ever gone before.",1
415,"Another Nolan's piece, this time with spacial theme. Mindblowingnes that makes Nolan so genial is masterfuly present here. Beside this, movie got more drama and emotional plot than another Nolan's movies. Science incrediblely fits here too. Another Nolan's goal.",1
416,"This is the first movie i rate with a straight 10 since i registered to this site. The acting is really good, the special effects are nice to watch, the story is just **** There are not much movies with a good story like you get here. Its the same **** you got with Matrix 1 or Inception, its just you doubt the world as we know it afterwards, without the ""it was just a movie and cant be real""-thought. The stuff shown in this movie ""could"" be realistic. This movie makes you doubt all you know about the universe and time and the way humanity ""understands"" it (or not). On the other side it made me cry two times and im not a guy who cries much or often at movies. There are some heartbreaking scenes in it, the end is one of it, and by ""end"" i mean the whole last 20 minutes of the movie. I love this movie, for me - its art, and im sad i waited until 2016 to watch it. One of my new favourite movies ! You get good science fiction, some kind of light post-apocalyptic world and a story about the love of a father to his daughter Characters 10/10Acting 10/10Effects 10/10Story 12/10",1
417,"Christopher Nolan is a great director. I love most of his films. Inception used to be my favorite. But now, it is Interstellar. Interstellar has literally the biggest scope ever in a movie. And for the most part, it works. Yes there are some flaws that might bother people. But this movie is too amazing to not give it the perfect 10. That is just my opinion. At the bare minimum, it is worth the watch. Just like usual, Matthew McConaughey is fantastic in this. Overall, probably my favorite movie of 2014.",1
418,"Though I haven't seen all of Nolan's films, I have greatly enjoyed what I have seen so far (Insomnia, the Batman trilogy, and Inception), and with sci-fi being one of my favourite genres, seeing 'Interstellar' eventually was a no-brainer for me. Despite its 169 minutes, it didn't seem long at all (if a film is well made, then the longer, the better) and it's resoundingly clear that Christopher is excellent both in getting fine performances from his actors and, along with his brother Jonathan, in writing scripts. What makes the film special for a sci-fi work is that he doesn't have to show any monster--nothing is truly more scary than humanity itself. This is a work that can combine an excellent explanation of the theory of relativity yet still show that the only things that truly matter are the relationships we develop in our everyday lives. My favourite film of all-time is still one of the most ambitious, '2001: A Space Odyssey', but it's very comforting to me that six generations after the birth of cinema, and the Faberge eggs of genius that have come along the way, from Georges Méliès' 'A Trip to the Moon' and Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis', that outstanding works of science fiction, such as 'Gravity', 'Ex Machina' and this fine film by Nolan, are still being made. There's hope for us yet!...",1
419,"Interstellar will be remembered for it's beautiful photography and original soundtrack, and despite the fact that Nolan makes a personal effort in this film, he fails to go deep enough into his themes without leaving the conclusion of the whole picture a little bit cheap. Still, the cinema experience is extreme, and if you get carried away by the tempo it's easy to be touched by the ending.",1
420,"The plot holes I looked past, the dialogue was cheesy, but all in all this was one of the best movies I've seen this year. A serious 2001 vibe was felt throughout the theater, but it was different enough to be called its own. The only real gripe, which I CANNOT look past is the loud music during dialogue. REALLY? I mean, it's a fantastic soundtrack, but it's kind of hard to be in the moment when you can't even hear the characters' emotions!! The best example I can give *MAJOR **** SPOILER AHEAD* was when Dr. Brann (Brann? Brand? I don't **** know) died. the dialogue made by him was ACTUALLY IMPORTANT but INSANELY hard to hear due to the music. The creators said it was because they wanted to make the emotions clear not through dialogue, but through the music. Sensible, but STILL, as I've already said, I CAN'T FEEL EMPATHETIC WHEN I CAN'T HEAR WHAT I NEED TO BE EMPATHETIC ABOUT. That's the only gripe I have with this movie, other than a few obvious creative license uses like *SORT OF SPOILER AHEAD* someone surviving going through a black hole when they should have been crushed due to the gravity. In addition the CGI was STUPENDOUS. It really felt like it was actually filmed, not CGI'ed. On top of that, they hired a real astrophysicist to develop an engine to accurately represent a black hole or wormhole. That takes some serious dedication. All in all, if you haven't seen any other movie this year, see this one. 9/10.",1
421,"The large hype prior to its release and perhaps the expectation attached to a Nolan film made this one a ""must see"" in 2014. It seemed pretty clear from the start that Nolan was quite precious about this particular film and in hindsight... might have cost him a really great one. Despite Interstellar's stunning visuals, the film's screenplay never lives up to the same heights. Nolan puts a fair amount of effort explaining the science behind the mission aiming to salvage humanity, however the information seems forced and you begin to feel as if you're in a physics lecture, with an unconvincing lecturer. Zimmer's musical score is excellent and in combination with the visuals, really gives Interstellar the desired operatic quality as could be experienced in films such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Nevertheless, the powerful score is often used to over-sentimentalize the love bond between Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) and his daughter, causing the film to feel sappy at times. The conclusion to Interstellar raises a couple of questions and the explanations provided aren't the easiest to swallow, however, what it does guarantee, is a great debate upon viewing and for that alone a film worth seeing.",1
422,"Interstellar es una película que se eleva a los niveles del espacio y que consigue volar en todo lo alto. Esta película es un film magnífico, que te hace pasar por varias emociones a medida que avanza en su intensa y disfrutable trama que no te dejará parpadear, conteniendo un grandeza impresionante y que resulta ser tan emocionante que incluso te podrá hacer llorar (de hecho, yo lloré). Sin dudas Christopher Nolan ha logrado hacer un largometraje grandioso con unos fuertes efectos visuales y que te llevará a un inigualable viaje por el espacio lleno de intensidad, emoción, con un muy buen reparto y, además, aparte de también ser interesante e inteligente, te atrapa y te cautiva de una manera fascinante e intensamente potente.",1
423,When they landed on one of those planets and spent just a few hours there whilst one of the crew remained in the mother ship near by in space and when they returned to the ship and were notified they had been gone for 23 years and a friend of mine confirmed that that is actually a possibility!?! I felt like bacteria.,1
425,"While its scientific accuracy is too convoluted for some people including myself, Interstellar is a film with a genuine heartfelt story, top-notch cast performances, amazing special effects and excellent directing from Christopher Nolan. Rating: 9/10 Pros:+This movie isn't one of those tearjerkers that manipulates your feelings. This movie could make you cry because it has a genuine heartfelt story. I probably cried five times during the movie or so.+The performance from Matthew McConaughey is amazing and he really plays his role excellently.+This deserves a separate bulletin because Jessica Chastain and Mackenzie Foy played the role as adult and young Murphy consistently and perfectly. They're my favorite actresses in this movie.+The special effects is amazing and it felt really realistic as if I am in space with the characters in the movie.+This is my first time watching a movie directed by Christopher Nolan and I can see why he is such a well-respected director. The directing in this movie is excellent. Neutral:.The scientific accuracy is quite convoluted for some people including myself. It seems like you need to have a much more clear understanding of science in order to get the movie's science. If this movie were used as a science lesson taught by a Science teacher, it would totally help.While its scientific accuracy is too convoluted for some people including myself, Interstellar is a film with a genuine heartfelt story, top-notch cast performances, amazing special effects and excellent directing from Christopher Nolan.",1
426,"Not only is it visually stunning and has some really beautiful camerawork, but the acting especially from lead star Matthew McConaughey is top notch. in my opinion this is Nolan's most visually appealing film since Inception in the way that there are many and turns throughout the second and third acts and yes this is better than Inception. However, like Inception the third act will lose some people and the consensus is somewhat correct that it does lose it's grasp on trying to be an extremely intelligent film.",1
427,"I'm writing this review a couple of months after having seen the movie - so I might not remember everything in detail. However, thinking about the movie many months later, it still strikes me as one of the most moving and amazing movies I have ever seen. An absolutely magical movie, loved it. Even though Matt Damon is an unnecessary **** in it, the good outweighs the bad by a factor of a million.",1
428,"One of the best movies I have ever seen.  It just does everything well.  When you get a movie like this it is an experience..  Not just a movie. I'm not generally a matthew mcconaughey or Anne Hathaway fan,  but you forget about that pretty fast and matthew mcconaughey is actually very good here,  Anne Hathaway..  Not so much.  Still a awesome movie/spectacle.  Worth seeing.",1
429,"Interstellar is a breath of fresh air that one breathes in when ascending beyond the choking clouds of remakes, reboots, sequels, and explosions masquerading as stories. It presents an ambitious plot and makes strong attempts at presenting the very real challenges of interstellar travel and colonization, especially those related to relativity and distance. I honestly have a hard time telling good acting from great acting, so I'll say the acting is good enough for me to not have to suspend disbelief. The dialogue is interesting and the plot is compelling. The ending is a tad...unbelievable...but the rest of the movie is so good and so interesting that I'm forgiving the silly ending and pronouncing this a great watch. It's not for everyone, but if you liked The Prestige and Inception, you will like this movie. A true milestone in science fiction filmography that I found even more fascinating than the Dark Knight.",1
430,"It really depends on what you expect here. One things - this is a loo-ong movie. Even, if it was plot-perfect picture, 3 hours is a long time to keep your attention without getting tiresome or unfocused. And let me tell you - it is not plot perfect. Far from it. It is also hardly believable (at its own terms) and some of its core ideas are poorly explained (if not at all). It tries to hit an emotional nerve, which just comes out as purely annoying most of the times (at least for me), but also succeeds occasionally. And when it does, it still counts.From purely entertaining (and fictitious) point of view, it does rather well. But you should perceive yourself as not very intelligent watcher to really let this one go. That was the main problem for me, - it tries to make some points, but I felt rather misguided. I also felt the movie considers me not that smart and even treats me a bit condescendingly.All in all, it is an entertaining watch and you'll appreciate it more if you are ready to make some compromises. And one more thing - it should have been at least half an hour shorter.",1
431,"Nolan lo vuelve a hacer, un guion muy interesante, como siempre sutil, la trama es sin duda un ""viaje espacial"" cargado de adrenalina con actuaciones increíbles, una banda sonora magistral, efectos muy buenos (bien usados) y sobre todo un guion excelente y como siempre una dirección espectacular.",1
432,"In my opinion Nolan is definitely inspired by other-worldly forces in the universe, as was Roddenberry, creator of Star Trek, a self acknowledged Spiritualist/Medium. This movie has so many parallels with recent channelled literature on futuristic cataclysmic predictions regarding humanity's greed and stupidity causing food scarcity on Planet Earth etc. (see 'D.M. Langdon, Universal Wisdom of the Golden Age' as one recent example). The realities of time/ space /quantum physics, and the ability of love to transcend all universal laws is portrayed in spectacular and breathtaking visuals.The only downside for me was that some of the casting wasn't convincing (Hathaway in particular). Highly recommended in Imax.",1
434,"I've seen it twice now. Amazing movie. It's one of the most audacious films I have seen. Because of this, I understand why there is some people that didn't like it, the final scenes are just mindblowing. But it's a kind of mindblown that some people will embrace and others will reject. However, I as a critic spectator I applaud the creative plot, great acting,beautiful visuals and exciting action scenes.",1
435,I enjoyed the movie.  There were some missing elements and some stretched realities (such as the ship and the amount of fuel it would take to escape these planets gravity well etc) and some things were obviously condensed for time.  But if you could sit back and displace those scientific realities and open your mind to possibilities it was a very nice ride.   Many many different issues were touched on.   Acting was very well done as usual my Mathew who is one of my new favorite all time actors since True Detective.  It was worth the money and well worth the purchase to keep in your library to watch in the future.   Is it a classic like 2001?  No... but it had a very nice concept about how Black Hole's work and could be like.,1
436,"The movie is... I don't know I cannot find one word to describe it. When you see a movie with Nolan as director you expect something new, something never seen before and something simply astonishing. Well... INTERSTELLAR is that kind of movie fos sure! Incredible pictures from space, fantastic music (Hans Zimmer - great job) maybe sometimes too loud (that why 0,5 point lower in score in my opinion) mixed with dramatic silence in space (that's what I'm talking about!) That's on the one hand - brilliant. But there is a plot and emotions with are not so deep as you can assume. OK. Just OK (another 1,5 point lower). The movie is not a masterpiece but it is a great pleasure to see it. Plus Nolan's imagination is endless and the idea of Black Hole just simple WOW. 8/10",1
437,"Popcorn which I had bought to eat was useless. I didn't have time to eat it. Its scale was overwhelming, so I couldn't  close my mouth. The description of the universe surpassed my imagination. Also, It was not that difficult unlike I had condcerned even though I am not good at physics. I wonder if I could watch more shocking movie than this in my life.",1
438,"Interesting to observe another sci-fi interpretation from Christopher Nolan that does not cease to entertain the senses though it closes down to 3 hours. It's not a documentary, establishing that in mind before watching it is important to avoid the unnecessary criticism of the scientific glitches in the film...",1
439,"-1 For PG 13 and Plot holes. The first time I saw this it was a 10/10 , I had even rewatch it again.. It's already for me a classic music 10/10, visuals 10/10, story 8/10. If you had/have kids or are responsible for kids like an older brother this movie will make you cry like a baby I went to watch this with 2 of my friends, we all cried and left the movie theater feeling awe at how great it felt. The movie is essential about time and how it gets mess up once you travel outside our solar system and about love, loss and being absent while your son or daughter grows without having you present on their life. A must watch for Scifi dads, mothers, sisters and brothers truly an amazing experience.",1
440,A very entertaining movie that starts slow but gradually develops into a simple plot covered behind a whole bunch of scientific technicisms. One of the best sci-fi movies from the last decade with great special effects and CGI.,1
441,The film have a heavy impact by watching the first time. The constellation of the father and the daughter is so exiting and full of experience. The movie took my emotion and throw it though the atmosphere to the highest point even possible.,1
442,"An exciting sci-fi thriller that will leave you wondering what secrets the universe could hold and what we will be capable of in the future. It's smart, different an unique but what else would you expect from a Christopher Nolan movie? Personally I do wish they would've spent more time on other worlds an less on earth. It's a little slow starting off but it speeds up. If you liked Inception and/or enjoy Christopher Nolan films you should really check this one out. I give it a 7 out of 10",1
444,"Interstellar is a movie that is finally able to take something completely new and turn it into one of the best movies of 2014! Christopher Nolan did very well in directing the movie, the cast is perfect and the visual effects are stunning! The realistic behaviour of time, and how once perspective of it can change, is just the icing on the cake!",1
445,"Interstellar is not a bad movie, i went into this one with high hopes but was let down abit, i dont know why there just wasn't really anything to rave about here its mostly pretty straight forward but then hard to wrap your head around in some places. McConaughey and damon give a good performances although damon is only in it for a short while. not bad on the whole just nothing outstanding in my book.",1
446,"First let me get the reason why I didnt give it a 10 out of the way. unnecessary dialogues, plot flaws?, movie plot was kinda all over the place. Undeveloped characters. Just alot of questions that you have to figure out as an audience, but what a great movie still. I didn't watch it in IMAX but I really wish I did, the science was truly interesting and for a viewer that tends to predict the movie as it goes on, I was quite pleased how it turned out. and I loved the relationship between Murphy and Cooper. Gets right in the feels Great movie, really gets you thinking about the future of humanity :3",1
447,"OH MY GOD, best movie for the last few years. It is better to watch it in cinema, cause of pure sound and image... You will love this sounds and music, i can't describe how beautiful they are. watch it, enjoy it.",1
448,"First of all this movie should have won more rewards, The science that was put in the movie about relativity and quantum physics is just astonishing to the human brain that you can separate time in space. the movie hits all aspects that emotional and humorous side that keeps you entertained throughout the whole movie. so i am giving this movie a big  o'whooping 8 in my book.",1
449,An extraordinary movie just as expected from Nolan.This movie has so much going on and everything ties up in the end.While some people try to find different complains and plot-holes I'm just here enjoying this film and appreciating it's glory.The acting is superb as expected from all these amazing actors and the Visual Effects are so good and well done that makes me so happy to know that they actually won an Oscar for that.The story holds up in so many levels to some of the greatest movies ever.I really can't understand why so many people keep on hating on this but I totally love this film and I'm just glad that God created Nolan and he started making movies cause it's such a blessing.I feel sorry for those who can't really see the greatness of this film.,1
450,"Christopher Nolan has never shied away from a challenge and the one he has taken on with Interstellar may be his most prodigious thus far - bigger than delivering an end-to-start chronology in Memento, more impressive than the mind-bending contortions of Inception, and more daunting than re-imagining Batman into the most unique superhero franchise of the 21st century. Interstellar is simultaneously a big-budget science fiction endeavor and a very simple tale of love and sacrifice. It is by turns edgy, breathtaking, hopeful, and heartbreaking. It's an amazing achievement that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with the best sound system possible. Nolan has crafted Interstellar as a movie theater experience. Watching it at home, no matter how good the sound system is, won't match. This is one time when the IMAX surcharge is worth it. Interstellar is science fiction. It's not space opera. It's not futuristic fantasy. It's what the term ""science fiction"" was coined to represent. It presents a viable future in which space travel, while possible, is dangerous and uncertain. Starships aren't zipping from planet to planet. Space craft aren't firing lasers, phasers, or photon torpedoes. Travel across long distances uses the dangerous and unpredictable method of entering a wormhole, not engaging Warp One or making the jump to hyperspace. Time dilation comes into effect in the presence of a black hole and there's even a little bit about the relationship between quantum mechanics and relativity. This isn't Star Wars, Star Trek, or Guardians of the Galaxy, and anyone who approaches it with such expectations will be disappointed. It's more along the lines of recent movies like Contact (which also starred Matthew McConaughey) and Gravity in that it acknowledges science rather than ignoring the rules of reality as we understand them. It will be difficult to find a review of Interstellar that doesn't reference 2001: A Space Odyssey and there's a valid reason for that. Nolan at times uses Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece as a template, especially during moments of grandeur. Hans Zimmer's score is no less crucial to Interstellar than ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" was to 2001. Yet, this is no mere copy of Kubrick's film; in fact, it goes far afield. There's heroism, a la The Right Stuff. It's also a warmer, more emotional experience - less stately and abstruse. In fact, found at the core of this big budget adventure is the most relatable thing imaginable: the feelings of love and trust that bind father and daughter. It's almost a fusion of Kubrick and Spielberg. The film is nearly three hours but there's enough story here for something a lot longer. In condensing it, Nolan has made something 169 minutes in length that breezes by faster than many productions half its length. He accomplishes this by establishing a blistering pace during Interstellar's meatier sections, including expert cross-cutting between Earth and space during a powerful ""fire and ice"" sequence. Visually, Interstellar looks great. Nolan understands all the facets of special effects technology (except, perhaps, old age makeup) and uses them to their best. Hans Zimmer delivers an operatic score that, although occasionally drowning out dialogue (more a mixing issue than a scoring one), adds to the overall experience. Sound is important to Interstellar - when the rocket lifts off around the 45-minute mark, the bass shakes the entire theater. It has been a tremendous year for McConaughey. From Dallas Buyers Club to True Detective to Interstellar, he has won a Golden Globe and an Oscar and been nominated for an Emmy. Interstellar will give him another opportunity for Academy recognition: he's the glue that holds everything together. He's the human factor in a vast universe. His love for his daughter and his pain when he acknowledges her despair invests this movie with a warmth and feeling that no previous Nolan movie can boast. The supporting cast, which includes Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine, is strong, but McConaughey represents the heart and soul of Interstellar. For anyone with a hunger for real science fiction rather than the crowd-pleasing, watered-down version Hollywood typically offers (and that I often enjoy immensely), Interstellar is a satisfying entrée. I'd rank this alongside Memento and The Dark Knight as the best Nolan has done, and it's an immediate contender for one of 2014's best. The film deserves the label of an ""experience"" and the bigger the venue, the more immersive it will be. As event movies go, this is one of the most unique and mesmerizing.",1
451,"There is nothing so grand as to speculate on than the infinite. In an infinite cosmos, everything falls within the realm of possibility, and that may be why science fiction is so enduring as an art form — it promises revelation. Science’s unfolding of the universe, freed from the morass of religious archetype, is the saga of modern spirituality that plays out in science fiction. Yet, there has always remained a quaint cautionary aspect to science fiction. Storytellers and audiences remain suckers for parable. As much as we crave escape into the unknown, we crave guidance from above, Christopher Nolan’s epic sci-fi film, “Interstellar,” explores the foibles of seeking either. “Interstellar” is richly steeped in the classicism of science fiction, which is surprisingly hermetic as a genre. More often than not, science fiction stories are tales of apocalypse or transcendence, rocket-wreathed journeys of harrowing adventure. And like other sci-fi films before it, “Interstellar” walks familiar scorched earth. It is a cautionary tale, a vision of global apocalypse, in addition to being a Homeric journey of discovery. Yet “Interstellar” instantly defines itself as one of the landmarks of the genre. Transcendent and harrowing, it is probably the finest science fiction film produced in decades. What’s miraculous is how fresh Nolan makes his classically crafted sci-fiction film feel, shaping it with absolute modernity. “Interstellar” is Nolan’s best film to date and most certainly among the most beautiful science fiction films ever made. The screenplay, written by Nolan and his brother, Johnathan, is unabashedly intelligent. Not since Paddy Chayefsky’s “Altered States” has such high-functioning dialogue been chewed onscreen by geeks. And while its constructed as neatly as a pyramid, the layers of the story might seem confusing to some unwilling to invest at least a little thought at the movies. But for those who venture into “Interstellar” for intelligent sci-fi, the threads of the tale weave themselves deliciously back together by its conclusion. Even as it fulfills the sci-fi purist’s quest for substance,”Interstellar” is also a grandly orchestrated piece of popular entertainment, driven by family drama, suspense and moments of blazing action. It’s a complex film, ambitious in its artistry, yet a film that mainstream audiences won’t feel put off by. Clocking in at nearly three hours in length, “Interstellar” is also a marathon of a movie. It’s a movie for the bingeing generation. Yet its length is befitting the ambitions of its story and the stately verisimilitude of Nolan’s mise-en-scène. “Interstellar” is set in the not-so-far away future when a dust storm-whipped Earth teeters on extinction. It’s not greenhouse gases or oil reserves that have done in mankind, but a vegetative blight starving out nations and throwing the planet’s O2 levels into chaos. Nolan wisely does little finger-pointing (Monsanto, anyone?) or proselytizing in his story. It suffices to say that the world is quickly going out with a whimper, not a bang. The big moments of planetary splendor even outshine the seminal work Kubrick did in “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Jaw dropping images of tumbling spacecraft spinning through the rings of Saturn, helpless and dwarfed by the giant denizens of our solar system, are breathtaking. Those seeking a visual trip to space won’t be disappointed: planetary splendor is on plentiful display. And the special effects depicting where no man has gone before — through the mystery of worm holes and black holes — coupled with Han Zimmer’s blistering score that nearly renders you unconscious at times, are cosmic thrill rides that you won’t soon forget. Nolan lays down his particle physics and turns to his metaphysics in a storyline that suggests the greatest self-perpetuating force in the universe is our spiritual bond to each other. Unlike Kubrick’s orgasmic Nietzschean rendezvous at the finale of “2001” with the supreme being, Nolan turns to Jung’s animus and anima, the masculine and feminine archetypes of the subconscious mind, for his own unifying theory.  Kubrick has always been accused of being an icy thinker, but it’s here that Nolan proves himself to be the man of science, at least psychology. And Cooper’s voyage to the edge of a black hole, where time bends like a willow front, is cleverly played out in context of the chasm of separation between father and daughter. Their love and loss transmitted over the years in melancholy, one-sided electronic messages, is perhaps another parable for our times. Nolan has always loved playing with the structure of his films, framing them like Chinese puzzles and “Interstellar” is no different. But he does it here with such subtlety and well-defined logic that there’s no overly clever feel to his devicing in “Interstellar” — the story feels natural and inevitable and works perfectly within the genre of science fiction.",1
453,"One of the best sci fi movies I've ever watched. Even thoug most of the ideas that justify the science on it are pure theory, even Neil deGrasse Tyson said it's one of the best documented  movies ever. In fact, Kip Thorne was the science counselor. Well written, an amazing soundtrack and an over the top acting, with the realistic feeling all the special effects had (they look more practical than CG, and that's a HUGE plus on a sci fi movie).I have to say that it could be difficult to understand to someone without any phisics knowledge, but it's the only fail I can found on it.I wish i could forget about the movie to rewatch it and feel again the same i felt when i watched it.",1
454,"The best movie I've watched since 2001 A Space Odyssey and The Godfather. As a matter of fact, I didn't really believe that any movie could excel the above mentioned; but Interstellar did. Those who didn't like the movie, fit in two categories IMHO: 1 - those who do not understand enough of modern physics, which is not that hard to grasp without having to delve into the crude math of it and 2: the ones who do understand the physics aspects of the movie but got tangled with the points that it's not real physics. It's a movie, not an astronomy documentary for heavens sake! Seat down and enjoy that masterpiece! 10/10 is my score!",1
455,"Christopher Nolan is a genius. This movie is the best I've ever seen and everything about this movie is great. The effects, the story, the acting. Just perfect. TARS is hilarious and McConaughey is spot on in his performance. This movie is breathtaking and I guarantee you will cry and f you don't you'll come pretty gosh darn close.",1
456,"This movie isn't bad; it just isn't as good as both Dark Knight movies. WAY too long I think was the problem. This movie felt like a combination of two movies. I personally like Gravity more but this is still a great, touching movie with a somewhat satisfying ending.",1
457,"I had really high hopes for this movie. The setting was very promising. I was, however, quite disappointed with the latter part of the film. I did not understand why the astronauts were making such bad choices when exploring the new worlds beyond the wormhole. Why did they have to first go to the planet that would cause the longest time difference compared to Earth time? Very beautiful movie, nevertheless.",1
458,"F*ck al the bad comments. It's an amazing film and if you don't like it, you're just not interested in science and awesomeness ! I don't care how long it is, it's freaking amazing! I could watch it for days!",1
459,"This movie is a homage to Kubrick's Odyssey. That's why movie loses scientific and logical sense after the first half. Zimmer again did a marvelous job in his soundtracks with incredible build-up and that hard to describe feel of old sci-fi movies. The plot twist is one of the most unpredictable things you may ever imagine since I anticipated protagonist's death after the final scene. I rate this movie 9 for these reasons - Great soundtrack, cinematography, CG and employment of practical effects, story and build-up. The movie just falls short in constantly changing aspect ratios and a rather dull intro.",1
460,"(Spanish) Todas las personas que conozco, que han visto la película dicen qué, o es una obra maestra de los tiempos actuales, o está muy sobrevalorada. Yo soy de los primeros. Soy muy especial para las películas, aunque me gusten mucho mucho siempre se me quedo con la espina clavada, de que podría haber sido mejor, podría no haberme aburrido tanto en x parte, la historia en x sitio podría haber sido llevada de otra manera... pero con Interestellar me quedé con los ojos como platos, de principio a fin. Es cierto que los primeros 30 minutos parece una película genérica de misiones secretas estadounidenses, pero eso es lo bueno, de ahí al final solo va hacía arriba, no se desinfla en ningún momento. Y el final... que decir del final. Impresionante. Desde La Vida de Brian o 7even, una película no me hacía quedarme pegado a la pantalla de tal manera. En el primer ejemplo por lo divertida que es, en el segundo por la intriga, en Interestellar por lo increíble que es. Esa es la palabra perfecta para describirla: INCREIBLE. 10/10.",1
461,"I'm not convinced this movie is a spectacular film that will be considered a classic decades from now like some but I definitely enjoyed it. The plot can be very confusing but this is intentional, as there's some crazy science talked about in it, which I won't spoil. Basically, if you enjoy science fiction you should enjoy this movie. It's certainly well written and well acted but, again, it'll confuse you at times. This sin't why I gave it an 8/10, though (that's just because I didn't enjoy it enough for a higher score). It's an enjoyable and sometimes emotional adventure that, like I said, any science fiction fan should enjoy.",1
462,"Interstellar isn't revolutionary, but it's going to make you feel. I can't remember the last time a movie simultaneously made me feel like I was going to throw up and on the edge of my seat in suspense at the same time. Set in what I would assume is about 50 or 60 years in the future, some huge event has happened on Earth and the human race is struggling to survive. While watching, I assumed that I was about the age of the grandpa – Donald – and he used to live in a world where billions of people wanted and needed everything, which sounds strikingly similar to the world today. A subtle push for sustainability while providing riveting entertainment The opening scene reminded me a lot of school, with the people narrating the farms and the house. It struck me as kind of odd – like someone is looking back at this moment. As it turns out, a hundred or so years in the future, they will be. This movie may be about Cooper, but it's truly for Murphy. Everything that happened was in one way or another, by the act of a human or not, to let her save the human race. This is a realization we get later on though. The movie is like a circle. We see pieces of the end at the beginning, but of course we don't know the significance of each piece. It seems messy and out of place until that light bulb goes off in your head. Driving Cooper to leave and save the human race is his family and his desire for adventure. ""We used to look up at the sky and wonder about our place in the stars. Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt."" Sometimes I think the events that transpired were improbable, and the truth is that they probably were. But this is never going to happen to me and it's not up to me to decide how much of a genius Murph truly is and if they really could find the coordinates to NASA that changed their lives. There is so much foreshadowing for practically every event throughout, but the magic is in us not picking up on the real meaning until later. We're also introduced to a 5-dimensional being. I have absolutely no way of knowing if this is a possible or not, so why not just sit back and enjoy. They left the humans a wormhole to another galaxy to save themselves and that is just what happened. There is a series of events and misfortunes that occurs out in space, but the main controlling factor is the space-time continuum. It keeps us worried about those back on Earth, because it may just be too late for them. Cooper misses seeing his kids grow up. He sees their faces on a video projector when they're the same age as he is – losing all hope in him and in humanity. Eventually the crew in space even realizes that the real plan never was to return and save those that we know. It was to save humankind out in a galaxy far, far away. The equation has always been solved. Now it's up to Murph.Everybody in Interstellar teaches us a lesson. Whether it be love, selflessness, or resilience is up to us to decide. Mann's lesson is the desire to survive. Great lengths can be taken to not die, and the same will to live must be applied to all the humans back on Earth. This kicks in for Cooper and he sends himself through the black hole, only to find his daughter. It may be destiny, or it may just be for us to not understand and simply observe. ""Nobody believed me, but I knew you'd come back. Because my dad promised me."" The human race wasn't saved without loss and suffering, because that's what makes us feel, but it was saved. Thanks to (both) Coopers.",1
463,"Interstellar: ""The end of earth will not be the end of us.""  A day is coming when Earth, home to humanity will no longer have what it takes to sustain life.  It is up to man and man alone kind to save our existence.  Although this movie makes a very arrogant assumption regarding mankind's future abilities, it made for good entertainment.",1
464,"Liked the film. I expected more coming from an artist like Nolan. McConaughey, in my opinion of course, played a regular script and got better with great perfomances such as Caine and Hathaway. However, leaving apart the characters, the main story was simply amazing. I recommend this movie to watch a Sunday, if you are free. If you haven´t  watched it , you haven´t missed anything special.",1
466,"Christopher Nolan returns in magnificent fashion to blow audiences away once again. Interstellar combines the tools to make a spectacular space adventure, with those that make a heart wrenching human story. Viewers are pulled out of the cinema seat and into a far off galaxy, but remain emotionally connected to the characters throughout. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack adds to the stories epic proportion of twists and turns, stunning visuals and strong character development. Nolan once again grips the viewer from start to finish, in what is the best film of 2014. In truth, I expected nothing less.",1
467,"Despite Inception, He is lot more brave and creative. Things that keep shocking audience thanks to elaborate especial effects. Going through worm hole that scene made me like ""WOW"" or scene getting to the black hole was like showing some things that were easy to witness but yet mind-blowing. in Inception he was okay with these mad themes and fantastic atmospheres but he was great on screenplay. Here He is just otherworldly on themes and complex with story. Interstellar starts easily building a foundation for you to get into the world and then easily go through the imagination yet keeping the momentum of drama and the further movie gets the more you are amused. The masterpiece is so soft yet so bold. But the best thing is with the end. Could not have happened any better. Getting the message with a mind drifting complex phenomenon. Finally the movie has the edge to do what Wall-E does. I don't think sci-fi and drama could've blended any more divinely. One Word : Amazing.",1
468,"Shame this film turned such a good concept (space exploration) into such bogus! Clearly a concept that went way over the director and writers heads. This film isn't realistic, it explores made up concepts, and the plot is so simple yet the movie is tediously long.",0
469,"While way overlong, and a bit overrated, ""Interstellar"" is a pretty good film. There's strong performances, great special effects, and a lot of very powerful sequences, but it is nowhere near flawless. I'd recommend it for most moviegoers (especially big fans of science fiction), although, you'll probably be rolling your eyes at some of the cheesier elements, and will check your watch every now and then.",1
470,This movie had a very Interesting and unique storyline. It gets a bit confusing when they start talking about a lot of the technical aspects.  Overall it was an entertaining movie,1
472,"""Interstellar"" was a very good film, excellent special effects, very good performances, a charming soundtrack, and a touching, intelligent, and unpredictable plot, make this a film a work of art more of Christopher Nolan.",1
473,"If somebody asks me what the most underrated movie of the decade is I always say ""Interstellar"". ""Interstellar"" is a modern masterpiece that needs to be seen. I never found myself bored or lacking of attention because the movie was so engrossing and immersive. I felt like I actually went to space and went through a huge black hole. Many peoples complaints about the movie are about the ending. I don't find the ending bad at all, actually I thought the ending was imaginative and really brought the emotions out of me. The ending where he finally saw his daughter and she was on her death bed getting to see the one thing she was searching for her whole life was heartbreaking and really touching. Yes it is very unlikely, practically impossible what happened, but when did we start getting so serious when we watch. Why don't we watch movies for a good story and great time anymore?",1
474,"I love movies.  The escape.  I especially love this genre.  I think this was a first re movie, CG was fantastic, a sci-fi epic driven by the human heart and love.  Fabulous!",1
475,Interstellar does what no movie has done before: make you think about everything you know. This is insanely a true instant classic thanks to the magnificent work from director Christopher Nolan,1
476,Christopher Nolan does it again at making such a wonderful masterpiece that not only talks about purpose of life but it tells the point of who we are and where are we going,1
477,"Thank you Mr Nolan for such a Masterpiece . I saw the back stage of making how you made the film . Your effort for making the outstanding music of the film . The great play , the great actor and actress for this film .it was very fascinating the view of the sea in another planet .",1
478,"So my review must be 150 characters long... this movie has changed my life,this movie has changed my life,this movie has changed my life,this movie has changed my life.",1
479,"Christopher Nolan's latest film proves to be his longest movie so far, yet also the best. Following up after ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"" is definitely something new. I started watching this movie extremely late at night once, and told myself that I'd stop it halfway through so that I could get some sleep.But the engaging plot kept me awake to the very end, and I couldn't stop thinking about it after.And then, of course, there's the crazy soundtrack by Hanz Zimmer - everything is good in this movie!",1
480,"This review is written after watching Interstellar 4th time, Nolan has this habit to spark a curiosity which doesn't end before getting all the points and plots which director wanted us to dwell on.It is kind of movie that makes you restless, it shakes the core of your existence, it makes you to think grandeur and think big.We all are enchanted with this limitless sky over us, we all made stories about it, we place our Gods on it and sometime we hope for someone to come over from there to read our X-Files.This movie is about that curiosity and that addiction of ours with that unknown.With all the science and hope, all the black holes and time travel, Nolan also blended the blunt with the fragile, you will get ample dose of human nature and emotions in it, like a hopeful daughter of her father's return.As I said earlier this movie made me asking Big Questions, hope we can find some answers, somewhere.",1
481,A very unique take on space travel which becomes an almost spooky experience as time becomes the enemy of the main characters in a way that is most unexpected. Amazing experience in the cinema but a must see regardless!,1
482,"Some will name Interstellar's premise as exploration, mystery, or even love. These are generally true, but the heart of this movie is actually the human destiny to conquer. In a vast universe, the plot follows a team of scientists scrambling to save mankind. The astronauts make their way to the stars through difficulties. In each ordeal, time amplifies the characters' mistakes and successes to unforeseen outcomes. Hans Zimmer's musical score augments Interstellar's sense of helplessness and curiosity to extremes. I watched this movie on my computer screen, but it would be best to watch in a home theater or in IMAX. This is due to the jaw-dropping, unfathomable presentation of cosmic visuals in the movie. Interstellar takes the spot as my second favorite movie of all time. It is without a doubt deeper and more ambitious than Christopher Nolan's Inception. This is not to state I didn't enjoy that movie. Interstellar, like Inception, doesn't fit well to watch on a Friday night. It's more of a Sunday afternoon type movie! Prepare to ponder Interstellar's mind-numbing themes & concepts for several days after finishing it.",1
483,"I gave this movie a nine. And it is a movie that I would actually buy and keep to watch it again and again. For me, it is in the same ""league"" as Gravity and tugs at the heart strings. Very good action sequences and kept me glued to the screen constantly.",1
484,"Interstellar may be a failure on a story level, but Nolan's visual virtuosity is still enough to take your breath away and root you to your chair. Watch this movie online: http://www.watchfree.to/watch-2a0504-Interstellar-movie-online-free-putlocker.html",1
486,"This movie is brilliant. It develops the theory of relativity and parallel universes to great extends. If you have ever studied quantum physiques or those theories you will just love the movie. If not then you might find the movie a bit too informative and sometimes dull. The theories explanation in the movie are not really understandable but that is a no problem hence their complex nature. Instead these theories are simplified as much as possible. It has an extraordinary and dramatic atmosphere of a planet Earth which is basically on the verge of destruction with all of the extras such as people dieing  from starvation, water pollution, wars, crimes etc but the movie instead does not focus on that but on a trip to outer space trying to find a better Earth in the form of another planet in order to save the human race. I like the movie, the atmosphere, the soundtrack and the casting. I do think though that the acting was a bit over dramatic at some points and a bit over emotionless on other moments. Pans and corny dialogues are included as usual with such movies. The conclusion of the movie is completely unexpected and I really enjoyed its ending! You should watch that movie!",1
487,"Didn't enjoy this movie like i thought i would, i imagined there would be aliens the whole time but NO. the acting is really great but it was kind of boring to me, and really confusing, a lot of stuff don't make sense.",1
488,"Interstellar is a very good movie that is intense, emotional and full of action.  It plays with the concepts of space and science, and wraps it into a setting where humanity is on the verge of losing the ability to live on earth.Without spoiling the movie, I was worried that this would be another space movie that feels isolated from loved ones, and trapped like other non-fantasy space movies. These elements do exist in the movie, and Matthew McConaughey captures it with believable, intense acting. But I was pleased that the elements of loneliness of space were mitigated by incorporating more characters and places to feel more action oriented rather than a vacuum of space movie.  I would relate this movie to the movie The Abyss, where it can be frightening, but it has adventure and it has heart.The only issues are that the movie can get confusing with who is where in each scene, and what is each person doing as the scenes jump around.  Also the characters going to space were a little too fearless with almost no preparation together to conduct a crazy tough mission.  The director did the same thing in the movie Inception; an improbable, coordinated mission but no on screen preparation.  It did not ruin the movie, but took anyway some believability of these characters being real science people.  It is a complicated script and story and I give the director, Christopher Nolan, a pass to cut a few corners.  The script and the lines of the characters are brilliant as they show various philosophies and emotions that add great depth to this story.  It is not perfect but it is impressive.",1
489,"One of the best movies in years. My favorite ""realistic"" sci-fi movie ever. Interstellar is a breathtaking and dramatic journey through time and space. I am already looking forward to the next Nolan-masterpiece.",1
490,"The best thing about Interstellar is that, like Inception, the science and the ideas are as real, as sophisticated, and as advanced, as any ideas out there. If you see a critic or somebody saying this is convoluted or overly complex that says more about their lack of understanding than about the movie. We should be thrilled Nolan is thinking about and making movies about these things. Bravo.",1
491,Enjoyably amazing. Interstellar actually tells us that Earth's being terminated and how sad we all must be for the last lives of our green globe we called Earth.,1
492,"Just loved it in the first 10 minutes. Love the scenario, love the characters, love the story, love the music score, love the whole thing. including the special effects and I'm everything but a special effect guy.",1
493,"This is one of my favourite if not my favourite movie of all time. I've watched it over 20 times now. The soundtrack is just breathtaking. There are amazing scenes, like the cornfield chase scene and the water planet disaster. I do agree that this movie has flaws. Some characters are underdeveloped. Why is Cooper's son in the movie? He's just kinda.. there. The only use he has is to add conflict near the end. It's also odd how Murph holds a grudge on Cooper for so many years. Nobody would be that stubborn. Some of Cooper's crew is just kinda there, like his son. They are never developed. The guy with the beard dies when they reach the water planet and the black guy dies on the ice planet. They are never developed. The movie is more focused on story rather than characters. Even the story is flawed sometimes. For example, we hear about Cooper's wife once and how she died, yet she is never mentioned again. Don't you think she should be a bigger part of Cooper's life? At this point, I'm just nitpicking small things. The movie overall is amazing. Movies are about experiencing awe and wonder, and Interstellar does that well. The messages and themes in Interstellar along with the breathtaking scenes and the soundtrack make it one of my favourite movies of all time.",1
494,"BEST SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE OF 2014!!! When i first saw interstellar i was AMAZED. The fact that they went to another galaxy and found three planets was great. Interstellar is by far, my number one favorite science fiction movie.",1
495,"This movie has great plot, intense action and the storyline is incredible.  I will not spoil how awesome this movie is, but Interstellar is incredibly watchable and has a great story that touches on a variety of emotion throughout the movie.  I marked it at 5 stars because it deserves to be watched.  The director of Inception, in Sci-Fi modern reality, give Interstellar a look.",1
496,Ambitious is one thing interstellar is. I love the score and the performances are outstanding. The science was very interesting loved the talk about relativity and worm holes and black holes and I have to say I love Christopher Nolan. He is one of the best film directors out there. Was it perfect no. was it Christopher Nolans best film no. was it one of the best to come out in 2014 yes. not the best but one of the best.  also the third act is very confusing and dr.mann's motivation is sorta abrupt and not very clear. also the ending does not have that emotional punch like i wanted it to have. None of the less the space sequences were fantastic and the connection between cooper and his daughter was not sugar coated it felt raw and real and made me care for them. I love this movie go check it out it's fantastic. It is kinda confusing but this is a fine very good even superb standalone film with outstanding performances and great action and fantastic cgi.,1
497,"there is something to this movie I can not put in words, its the combination of music, acting, picture, the whole atmosphere and emotion.. it just works, and the strage thin the more I watch the movie the more I like it.. something very special",1
498,"Christopher Nolan keeps making classics, and Interstellar is the latest. Popularizing science, exploring the universe, amazing performances from Matthew and others and an ending that will have you (literally) yelling in the theater.",1
499,"É o meu filme favorito da vida! Queria desver o filme pra poder sentir o que senti tudo de novo, sentimento, coragem, solidão. O ator Matthews consegue transmitir tudo além do imaginado, com a imensidão do espaço e como ele pode ser cruel.   Interestelar não poderia ter só 3h de filme, poderia ser infinito por ser tão único.",1
