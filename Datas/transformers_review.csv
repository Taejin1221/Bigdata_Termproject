0, very nice movie...i wish trere will be Transformers 2.,1
1," It's amazing! on VFX, the Story, everything! You have to give it a shot... don't be narrow-minded.",1
3," Being a fan of the original cartoon (Generation1), I just can't hate on this movie as much as others try to influence me to. I felt it was a great adaptation of the series into film. I also enjoyed Bay's vision of what the Transformers should've been. Most of all I enjoyed the fact that I it made me a diehard fan all over again. If I had to complain about anything, was the lack of the Porsche for Jazz and Megatron and Starscream not having such a critical and deep role in the movies. The cartoons were awesome at making us emotionally attached the Autobots and decepticons. The only ones I felt that way about were Bumbole Bee and Prime. Superb effort on this flick though!",1
5, Tons of CGI Hot Chick Lame Lead Character Moronic Humor Infantile Dialog and Plot In Short: Entertainment for the Borderline Deficient!,0
6,"Special Effects 9/10, Action 9/10, Score 10/10, Cinematography 9/10, Sound Design 9/10, Film Design 9/10, Characters 7/10, Acting 7/10, Story 7/10, Humor 7/10, Pacing 6/10,Basically it depends what your looking for, if you are a teen or want a really stylised action film you will probably love it, if you are an adult and want a deep sci-fi story you will probably hate it. The best scenes are 10/10 the worst scenes are 4/10, under no circumstances should you believe anyone that gives this film a score in the red, there are several films I absolutely hate but I rate them fairly for its audience. People that are giving this lower than 6 seem to be very bitter people in general. Not only that but they probably believe that District 9 has a very good story when infact its just a bunch of semi-suggestive anti apartheid images superimposed over some terrible jokes.",1
7,"This film is **** **** Nothing at all good was used from the original Transformers, basically someone got the liecnse and created a half arsed peice of **** just to make money. The plot is about a big cube, there are no transformers untill half way in, and then they have ****e ones, even then they don't **** act anyhting like the characters should, they hardly **** talk, the kid who stars in this is a little piece of piss i saw in a ****ty kids program when i was younger, he is awefull, i don't know why but i look at him and his stupid ass smug face and i can imagine he just stinks of farts. I hope he dies. The 80s animated film is over 9000 times better.",0
8,I do not understand why people like this piece of **** It's almost pure bull****. But the second one took care of that. This moive is so goddamn insulting. We were supposed to care about that robot? What the **** Mr. Bay? **** you up your stupid ****ing AIDS-ridden ass. I just ****ing hate you. Stop making movies.,0
13,It's pretty bad. Far too convoluted and messy for something with such a simple plot at heart. It's shot interestingly until you realize that you can't make heads or tails of anything you see on screen other than Megan Fox's cleavage.,0
14, If you are looking for a real simple story line amazingly executed. Here you go... The computer generated imagery is phenominal.,1
15, Awesome! Never thought it could be made into film. Makes 40-ish adults like me drool like a pockmarked kid. The viewers applauded after the screening.,1
16,I can't believe the comments! This is the reason a no-talent like Michael Bay still has a job. We wanted to see The Transformers..not a dorks journey towards adolescent puberty. CGI was the only thing worth watching.,0
17," This had the perfect mix of theme, feel, and dialogue of the oldschool show, and the action, pace, humor, and effects of todays big-budget movies. For me this movie was perfect in what it was; a movie about giant robots coming to earth and dealing with humans while searching for the key to possibly rebuilding their home. Oh, and blowing a whole lot of stuff up.",1
18, A truly epic movie to be seen! One of the best movies of the year alongside the 300!,1
19," A great flick for all, with good humor, a clear line between good guys and bad guys, awesome action sequences, and a feel good essence.",1
21," seriously - why do some of you rate this so low? 0, 3, 4? that's ridiculous. i wish i could meet some of you in the street so i could f***in bury you into the ground instead of you bad-mouthing this movie. maybe it's the little kid in me trying to defend what memories i cherish about this franchise, but for you people to say it's deserving of such a low score is stupid. some comments from users: ""Since when is Optimus a Peterbuilt?"" ""This film is an Incredibly juvenile piece of garbage."" ""..a very, very, very bad movie.""he ALWAYS has those stupid F**king 1 liners.. For example in this film ""You shoot, i'll drive""."" these are amongst a few. think about what you just wrote - one liners? well, let's see: you are a human trying to communicate with a robot from another world while in the middle of a gunfight. did you expect to hear a complete dissertation explaining what what the alien should do? or should she just drive and assume that the robot would know what she had in mind? i know it may have sounded kinda cheesy, but be a little more understanding to the situation. next - ""juvenile piece of garbage?"" whoever said this should be shot in the head. no SH*T. key word: juvenile. did you think the target demographic of this film would be the same as that of say The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Letter from Iwo Jima, Pretty Woman, or Eternal Sunshine? the point i'm trying to make is OBVIOUSLY Transformers was made with intent to draw in people who gave a damn about the series 20 years ago up until today, NOT for older people looking for real-life scenarios. take it as it is - a movie about robots in disguise. if your brain limits your acceptance of a creative idea such as robots changing into cars, then sorry - you're already off on the wrong foot. quote ""bad acting...no plot"" as i see so many people criticize Bay for his work, i wonder what kind of movie you people were expecting. no plot? good robots try to defend bad robots from taking over earth, and in doing so inadvertently involve a boy going through adolescent stages. COME ON WTF! you don't see the story? if you do a little bit of research, you'll also notice that Spike, in the original cartoon series, was also involved in a romantic affair so for you who disapprove of the love concept in the movie, this may have been a reason to include it. among other whines from users is product placement. seriously, if you were so busy looking for logos throughout the movie, you probably didn't want to see it to begin with and wanted to just pass time. do us all a favor and just shut your trap, keep your dumb comments to yourself, and just move along. so you saw ""GMC"" or ""Pontiac."" big deal, grow up. did it bother you that much that it ruined the movie? cry me a river. lastly for people complaining about what vehicles were used, i somewhat agree (ex. bumblebee not a bug), but you have to keep in mind that they were trying to blend in with times. honestly, i'm glad bumlebee wasn't a beetle because that whole car chase with him and barricade would have been weird (beetle vs mustang?). as for the others, optimus was a truck, jazz was a sportscar, (i guess, if you consider a solstice sporty?) and starscream was a plane. only possible gripe i can think of for this movie was megatron shouldn't be a plane and jazz should have been a better car. maybe my own comments on others may seem harsh, and for that i apologize, but i refuse to sit there and let a few bad user reports hinder other moviegoers from seeing this film, or let the rating drop considerably. everything about this flick deserves praise, regardless of your previous bias towards Bay. bottom line: no way should this movie be rated lower than a 7 (green = good on this site?). if you do, i'd like to know what kind of movies you DO approve of. constructive criticism should always be accepted, but saying a movie is completely worthless and not saying why doesn't do anything to help",1
22," If your hoping to see a thought provoking, soul stirring film...stay home. If you want to see a great summer blockbuster...then go see this movie. I am an old school transformer fan who was terrified of being let down. I was not.",1
23," It loses one point from me due to some of the lame humor (most notably the ""urination"" jokes). Regardless, this is the ultimate summer action flick, a slam-bang-crash parade of ""WOW"" moments that made me feel like a kid again. The CGI work is so convincing, I forgot it was CGI at all. It's the most fun I've had at the movies in a long, long time.",1
25," This movie was amazing. The intensity in which Bay approached this film came through on the big screen. I find some of the negative comments on the internet about this film hilarious. Many people came out of this film saying none of the characters had any progression and that it was a typical Michael Bay film. First of all, this is a movie about gigantic robots that turn into cars and smash/shoot/destroy everything around them -- where is the necessity for character progression? In addition, if this were anything less than a typical Bay film, I would've been disappointed. This movie was an action packed thrill ride that never disappointed. Shia and Megan's chemistry on set was amazing. Bay did a great job of addressing several different characters while managing to get across the storyline. Had this movie been any shorter, we would've been disappointed that he left things out. This movie lived up to every childhood expectation I ever had and I was pleased with the film as a whole.",1
26," Not as bad as reviewed by the pros. It was very humorous (on purpose) throughout, and the storyline keeps with the fun of the original series. While the battle sequences are deadly serious, the characters are all part of the fun storyline and no one takes themselves too seriously in this movie. I would recommend for fun, sit-back-and-enjoy-the-fireworks summer fare. Huge plus if you are old enough to remember the original series, as the characters are all fleshed out perfectly. Relax everyone...the movie wasn't written to earn an Oscar. It's just fun and very cool.",1
27, It's big. It's loud. It's fun. Whats not to like?,1
28," Awsome movie, only complaint: TOO MANY HUMANS!! not enough focus on the Transformers and their inter personal stories. Hopefully they'll fix that in 2",1
29, Another action film that thinks that fast paced editing makes for clever direction. When the plot is as wafer thin as this it hardly seems worth the while to even bother to take notice of the amphetamine fuelled action. Kinda boring.,0
30," I'm beginning to think that people have actually no opinions on this website and just try and go along with what critics say so they think they're right. form your own opinion! this movie was great. better than the more recent spiderman sequel which was one of my least favorite movies of the summer. And thank you, megan fox. i love you!",1
32," Oh. My. God. Transformers is the biggest and 2nd best movie Michael Bay has ever done (I'm partial to Armageddon). The screen is filled with awe-inspiring visuals and there is no lack of intense action to be had. Surprisingly, Transformers isn't just a 2 and a half hour action scene (unlike Live Free or Die hard). The acting and script are surprisingly solid, especially Labeouf's entertaining performance as Sam Witwicky. If there's anything not to like about the film, it's the occasionally balance issue. There are plenty of epic sequences in the film and plenty of humorous ones too (it's a very funny movie), but sometimes the scenes can intertwine, leading to some annoyances. It's kind of hard to find an epic feeling as Sam and his new girlfriend Mikaela (played by the stunning Megan Fox) marveling at the the sighting of Bumblebee in his robotic form when Sam is standing around with a shirt but not boxers. Still, it's a fantastic movie and should not be missed.",1
33," Transformations - AWESOME!! Everything else about this move - awesomely bad. The human characters and story line are nothing more than filler between Transformer battles, and believe it or not, the Transformer battles are few and far between. The attempts at comedy and romance are absolutely abysmal and the script as a whole may set a benchmark for all time worst . In fact, I am not at all convinced there even was a script. Of course you signed up for a movie about giant transforming robots so you may not care about script or story or characters, or anything other than CGI robots - and I was with you on that - unfortunately that eliminates about 90% of the movie because it is mostly filler.",0
34," The CGI was flawless and I wanted to like this movie but it tried painfully hard to be funny and completely failed. Every movie trick in the book was thrown out. The hot 22yo Australian girl who is smarter than the entire US government and military put together ETC ETC ETC ETC ETC. Movies like Aliens were capable of being a kick ass action movie but not insulting the viewers with every mindless movie cliche and painfully mindless pop culture ""funny"" reference. Great job on the CGI and bringing this to life but maybe if the writers/directors didn't treat us like we were 8, it might have been anywhere near decent.",0
35," Garbage. Another piece of crap from Bay. There's bad acting, bad action ""sequences"" (a few missiles are fired and that's it) and no plot. What'd you expect?",0
36, I haven't been that excited wathcing a movie in years. The film is amazing. This is what summer movies are all about!!!!!!,1
37, Great sound! Great voice work for the autobots! As for everything else... oh god... this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.,0
38," I've seen it in Italy. It's so funny! Shia Le Beuf is a Dustin Hoffman type guy, perfectly in part. Cars, Mega robot, hot brainy chicks, jokes, fun dialogues: there's all you can expect from a blockbuster. After three boring sequels, finally the real summer hit. Marco",1
40," Perfect staging with amazing action driven by human drama that is delivered via a solid cast. Humor action special FX, and a perfect rendition of the Transformers to film. The best action movie I've ever seen.",1
41," Worth every penny, and I'm going back tomorrow to see it again!",1
44," Amazing Movie, everyone in the theater cheered through the whole movie, they cheered when optimus prime appeared, they cheered when megatron came alive, and they cheered wildly at the end",1
45," Wow! ...stupendous entertainment for the hot , hot summer break. I waited through 5 power outtages at my local imax to see this thing and it was worth the $12.00 ticket!",1
46," This movie was unbelieveable! It was the best movie I've seen all year. It has great humour and so much action, but best ofd all, it has good acting! Special Effects were stunning and this is definatly a film you must got to see if you 10 or older. Humour is a bit crude for anyone under 10, violence is a bit much for anyone under 10. 9.8/10",1
47,Saw the sneak preview last night and it was amazing. i was blown away from the beginning to the end. the whole crowd was into it and clapping the whole way through. great experience definitely go see.,1
48, looks great!,1
49," Took my 11 and 8 yr old boys to it with my wife. We all loved it, boys said it was the best movie they'd ever seen. My wife and I were surprised - we really liked it too. The actors seemed to be having a really good time making this movie and there were some heartwarming moments, some good comedy, and most of all, non-stop action with some of the coolest CGI I've ever seen. I felt like I'd witnessed the next level of movie craft similarly to how I felt when I saw the Matrix for the first time.",1
52, I find it funny that the critics of publications such as The New York Times and The Onion can't seem to understand that the movie is targeted towards kids and teenage males. Either they were never fond of giant robots or they just forgot how to be a kid. A great movie all around. The cgi effects are worth the price of admission.,1
53," I thought it was awesome. The special effects were amazing. I grew up on the original transformers, so I thought it was ingenious how quickly and smoothly they transformed. I didn't like the sexual humor, which made me give it a 9 instead of a 10.",1
54, It's a Michael Bay movie.....about fighting robots. Anybody who whines about it not having a plot went to see the wrong movie. Don't expect a compelling storyline or major character development. This isn't an art house flick. It's giant robots destroying each other and everything in their wake. And it totally delivers.,1
55," LOVED it. I'm a fan grew up on the cartoon and toys but that doesn't change the fact that it was a fantastic movie. and i know someone will say ya ""FANtastic"" It had that absolute best CGI that is possible out there. it pushed ILM's computers etc to their absolute limits, nothing out there can even come close. HUGE explosions. great car chases ala normal Michael bay. it was funny, more then I expected. I personally think it's one of my new favourite movies. If your a fan you will LOVE IT! if your not a fan you will love it. you owe it to yourself to at least check it out.",1
56," It's really quite simple. If you grew up with the TRANSFORMERS, you are going to LOVE this movie. If you didn't you probably should go see something else. I loved it. ""What this movie needs, though, is more Soundwave!""",1
58," downright awesome. definitely the best movie of the summer, at least so far. Transformers featured some of the most amazing CGI work i have ever seen, and every scene featuring the transformers looked incredible. there were a few low spots, but nothing terribly bad. I've never been a big fan of Shia Lebouf's movies, but in Transformers it seems like he's evolving from another faceless disney star into a more mature and interesting actor. although, for a 2.5 hour movie, there could have been a little more plot/character development from the movie, especially when it came to the Decepticons. they were pretty much just randomly introduced about 3/4 of the way through the movie, and then the big fight began. still, i would definitely go see it again, and cannot wait for the DVD. 9.0 out of 10.",1
59, My Favorite summer movie yet. Great fun. Great action. Michael Bay is slowly redeming himself in my opinion. The Island was good too... oh wait. That was the first movie he did away from Bruckheimer. and now Transformers with spielberg. Hmmm...makes you think a bit don't it?,1
60, the best movie i ever saw,1
61, great,1
62," I loved the action scenes, but as a fan of the series I would have liked to see more relationship between Starscream and Megatron.",1
63," Anyone who give this movie less than a 6 is simply crazy. The plot was simple, easy to follow, and beyond a few minor annoyances entertaining to watch. The acting, again, other than a few odd sequences was also pretty damn good. The action, was borderline excessive, but it was also incredibly fun to experience, because in this movie it is definitely more of an experience than simply watching the film. In the end, this is one of the best action movies of the past 7 years and it is definitely worthy of the phrase ""summer blockbuster"", better than X-Men3 and Superman Returns by leaps and bounds. The whole GM thing is pretty damn ridiculous, meaning it is a ridiculous thing to be upset about. They are called Autobots, they transform into cars, no reason why we need 10 different company logo, just so some internet nerd won't have a conniption. Its called TRANSFORMERS, not William Shakespeare's Transformers, so go into it expecting a big, over the top loud, hell of a good time.",1
64," So much for movie critics huh? I believe that M. Knight Shamalan (however you spell his name) was right to kill a critic on his movie. Wow I wonder if these critics saw the same movie i saw. I have to say that it was it did not leave me wanting. So what they did not give you a detailed background on each and every character. Since when do we go to a movie for a history channel special. Easy plot, good action, funny. I give this movie a 10 yes thats right a 10.",1
65," I think that people trashing this film are missing the point a bit. A movie based on a collection of toys from the eighties is never going to produce a screenplay that will rival the Godfather. It is meant to be a bit of mindless fun and that is exactly what it is. If you let go a little bit and stop expecting it to be a masterpiece and instead treat it as entertainment you will enjoy it. The special effects are absolutely incredible and worth the ticket alone, there are also some surprisingly good moments of humour which dare i say i actually less predicatable than the tripe produced by the highly over rated simpsons movie. Transformers is meant to be simple fun and it is - as long as that is all you want it won't disappointed.",1
67," Utter, utter bilge. I wasn't expecting much, just a few laughs, some impressive effects and exciting action, but it failed to provide any of these. The script is tedious, witless and utterly devoid of charm. The Transformers change from car to robot in the blink of an eye, a total cop out that negates any clever mechanical movement. And the action is unforgivably tedious. Worst of all, it's far, far too long - this is simply a 2hr 30min commercial for American muscle cars and the US military. Massively disappointing.",0
69," 2 1/2 hours of pure Hollywood crap. As a matter of fact, I don't think I ever enjoyed a Micheal Mann movie. Just because it was packed full of ridiculous comic relief and backlot explosions makes it a blockbuster hit? I guess so. This is definitely a movie for the masses.",0
70, It's just fun! seriously.,1
71," This is one of the coolest movies ever. Period. This SUPPOSED TO BE AN ACTION MOVIE and is one of the most bad ass ever made. Whoever says it isn't ,doesn't like action, and shouldn't comment on it at all.",1
72," Loved this movie, can't wait for the DVD. In fact I have it pre-ordered already",1
74," I saw this movie 2 day ago (I'm living in Korea so it comes out sooner) and I thought it was pretty decent. As long as you are expecting SUPER corny lines and an almost 3 hour long flick, I think you'll enjoy the film. There were also plenty of good one liners along with a great job by the frantic Shia LeBeouf. Also, not to forget the most important part, the visual effects were pretty damn amazing.",1
75," Good fun, with only a couple of cringe-worthy sappy moments. The only major downside was the product placement, which was very much in your face. The Panasonic SD card and the GM cars being the standout examples. SPOILER: Golden moment - the All Spark hits a drink vending machine and turns it into a Decepticon that launches cans of soft drink from its weapon. Priceless.",1
76," ""Michael Bay in good movie shock!"" I've dreamed of a this movie becoming a reality for 22 years. I'm still reeling from it coming from one of cinemas worst directors!",1
77," No you will not receive any insights into the human condition or the universe watching Transformers, a movie about a toy franchise. What you do get is a profoundly entertaining summer popcorn movie, a cheesy and thoroughly preposterous smashup that also manages to be Michael Bay's first genuinely satisfying movie. And the special effects are just ludicrous to behold.",1
78, I pretty much agree with everyone who gave this movie a 7. The people that were upset about the plot and basic storyline need to realize thats not the point of the movie. its a summer action flick. and i had fun (unlike watching spiderman 3).,1
79," The only thing that I didn't liked was the action sequences, they lacked of detail and the whole thing was actually a big mess by the end. But in general it's a fun movie and to give it a comical approach it's what saves it from disaster.",1
80," Terrible movie. Transformers aren't old school. So many cheesy slo-mo ""moments"". I went into this thinking it was going to suck, but at least I'll get to see some cool robot fight scenes onscreen. No, not even that. The director went for that stupid new style of shaky-cam for the fight scenes. With most of the robots being solid gray, it was hard enough to tell what was going on in the fight scenes without the shaky-cam crap. Just a bad, bad movie. God it was bad.",0
81," It irritates me that people are so anxious to trash this movie because of the fact that Michael Bay directed it. It wasn't even cool to diss Michael Bay until South Park, and now every one loves to hate him because of the South Park precedent. Everyone should face the fact that mindlessly regurgitating opinions from South Park is the kind of mindlessness that South Park lampoons in every episode. I went to the movie not expecting much but finding that the movie actually had a soul that transcended being a built-to-order movie that would only please nerd devotees and actually became a film that was enjoyable because it played both to nostalgia (having grown up with transformers myself) and to enjoyability/ having a soul. Just because it is cool to trash a director doesn't mean that you can't at least watch the movie first before you get your opinions decided for you.",1
82," The best Michael Bay film yet. Exciting, great special effects and great touches of humor. We need more of these movies, a film I can takes my kids to see that is both for kids and adults. The box office receipts speak for themselves. The public loves it, critics hate it. Star Wars had the same problem in 1976.",1
83," I had low expectations entering this movie, and Michael Bay somehow managed to fall below them. Horrible directing, horrible story. Full of every cliche from the action movie canon. The special effects were not that impressive. And the Autobots were a bunch of goofballs.",0
84," As with all movies based on television shows or comics, it",0
85," This movie is the GREATEST movie of all time! I cannot possibly watch a movie that lacks transformers of any sort after watching this MASTERPEICE! If you hated Transformers, this movie will convert you to a Transfan and then you will be immersed into the purified awesomeness of this magnificent artwork that TOTALLY craps all over Star Wars, Harry Potter and LOTR and any other movie ever made and then kicks them in the family jewels so bloody hard that they will be vomiting them out! You MUST watch this movie! At least a million times in the cinema before buying the DVD!",1
86, First of all that film was AMAZING! but secondly can anyone tell me what song is being played when the camaro (bumblebee) drives off and comes back as the new camaro? i would be very grateful as it has been bugging me ever since i saw the movie! lol,1
87," I was expecting this to live up to my memories of the original franchise. It fell way short. The effects were amped up in overdrive, but that didn't mask the lack of intelligence or soul. Big dud.",0
88, Giving an '80' score to Anthony Lane's New Yorker review suggests Metacritic's sense of irony may be as rusty as old scrap metal.,1
89," A flawed, but very enjoyable movie.",1
90," Lack of Imagination, stupid plot...I wasn't expecting nothing special though..those American franchises (Spiderman, 4fantastics, sth..man etc.) movies are all crap and I think people,at least in my country, is realizing of that.",0
91, Megan Fox and Shia Labeouf need to get married. The action was ridiculous and Megan Fox was also breathtakingly amazing.,1
93, If you know there is some cheese factor carried over from trhe cartoon you will enjoy this great action movie.,1
94, This movie was amazing. Bay was made for this kind of movie and it felt like watching the first episode of the show if it was remade. It is also extremely well done visually.,1
95," This movie was amazing. I've seen it 5 times and it has been just as good every time. The plot was a little loose but the effects were utterly amazing. Also, the added humor and wit of Shia Labouf was unexpected but made the movie multi-dimensional. Can't wait for the sequel!",1
97, Fantastic! This is what a summer blockbuster is supposed to be. Awesome Action. The CGI is seamless and real. The thing that suprised me the most was how funny the movie was. Michael Bay nailed the tone that a movie based on a cartoon and toy should be. Tongue and cheek and silly while delivering jaw dropping action scenes. Well done. Plus Optimus Prime is the coolest character ever!,1
98," Transformers; A- I was really surprised. I didn't expect this movie to be as funny as it was. It's got such a great sense of humor, the action scenes are incredible, the effects are amazing, the characters are likable..... Steve Jablonsky provides a really cool musical score, too. It's overall a really fun movie and a real crowd-pleaser, even though you have to tolerate the occasionally (let's face it,) nerdy subject matter. I just really, REALLY, wish directors these days would please KEEP THEIR MOVIES UNDER 2 HOURS!!!!!!!!! It's getting pretty ridiculous now. Some editing to shorten the movie a bit and it would have been perfect. Easily director Michael Bay's 2nd best film (behind the excellent The Island.)",1
99," 7 for the average movie goer. 9 for most kids and boys. 4 for your more sophisticated movie reviewer. This is a thrill ride more than a movie. Great CGI and action. Some good acting mixed with some cheesy Independence Day-like nutty characters. Shia's character got annoying after a while with his fast talk and super hip-not so cool kid-being cool. These are the kids that run high schools, they aren't the ones hiding in the background!! Megan Fox is beautiful but doesn't do a whole lot other than being an object of super tanned lust. Michael Bay needs to lay off the slow motion, with military horn music...every movie he does this-knock it off, it's cheese. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese are the only two that keep this movie somewhat realistic, they did a good job. Rachael Taylor does an ok job until things get silly with her character. The transformers themselves are cool and the new looks are better than the look from the 80'sl. The decepticons to me were much better looking. The CGI is amazing. Optimus Prime's voice is as cool as ever. The fights are full of action. Overall Michael Bay proves to me that he still can't create real humans, but is great at creating simple macho action. Good movie but forgettable characters except for the transformers themselves.",1
100," An overlong, idea-void mess of a movie. It's just action scene after mind-numbing action scene of huge, clunky, metallic CGI-robots fighting and blowing each other up and blowing up big buildings, and then more robots fight each other and the screen is filled top to bottom with fires and explosions and loud noises. If this sounds like a fun time to you, enjoy. If this all sounds dull and stupid and mind-numbing and unnecessary, you are correct.",0
101, Sure the story might not have been great but how can you look past the action and outstanding CGI.,1
102," This movie is easily the best movie of the year if not best movie ever. I was sucked into the movie by the speedy movements and the loud noises. Beautiful Megan Fox put Transformers to the top of my ""favorite movies ever"" list.",1
103," Saw it at a sneak preview a week ago. As with all movies these days the trailers looked great, but the actual movie disappoints. Well, this is one movie that didn't. Might be the coolest movie I've ever seen in a theater. The perfect summer movie!",1
106," This movie is fantastic! it has a few flaws, but visually it's amazing.",1
107, Oh My. J Arr's review almost made this whole movie worth it. My goodness man. I laughed my ass off at your review. You rock dude. I can't believe you're passionately defending this movie. You're a bush vote for sure.,0
108," I really enjoyed this movie. It's probably one of the most memorable films I've seen in quite a while. I typically have a fairly short attention span, and I personally didn't think of the plot as mindless filler between shiny things fighting. The visuals were raw, gritty, and quite stunning. The only bad thing I have to say about the movie, is that it eventually ended and I couldn't watch it anymore. You can't go to a movie like this expecting to have a philosophical and intellectually enlightening revelation. It is what one would expect in a movie about transformers. I found myself watching the film with quite the shit-eating grin on my face for the majority of it. Of course, I grew up in the 80's playing with transformers myself. Conclusively, I feel this movie was worth the cost of the $10.50 admission ticket, and I would see it again. I'm looking forward to the DVD already.",1

110," Beautiful It really felt like you were there with these amazing giant robots, the action sequences are usually from the point of view of the humans and it gets reallt intense the only thing that brought this movie down a bit for me was the scene where they're looking for the glasses - a little too long but i just edited that part out in my head I got a little misty eyed remembering fond memories from my childhood overall well worth 10$ and a great diversion from stresses of daily life.",1
111," awesome movie. anyone who says the CGI was poorly done is either blind or some kind of special fx whiz and you're the latter, make us a movie then. otherwise shut up and like others have said before, don't expect a masterpiece - just a fun time",1
112," Transformers has all the makings of a great movie: humor, action, throwbacks to the original cartoon and movie, babes, killer robots, and a story. The people who give this a bad rating are the people who didn't get exactly what they wanted in every way. This movie was just plain fun and that is all the movie needed to ever be. I grew up with the transformers and i could not be happier with the movie. Nit picking has given this movie undue low ratings.",1
113," I've had an internal feud with anything ""Transformers"" so I naturally had very low expectations for this movie.Needless to say i went to see the movie, and loved it. The best special effects I've seen. They do an incredible job of making the movie enjoyable for hardcore fans,and people like me that don't know anything about Transformers. Watch this movie for what it is, a special effects action-comedy movie based on a kids cartoon. Also keep in mind that this is the first movie in a trilogy, so don't get mad if you feel it left out some stuff it should have had. Like the first Pirates movie, this one introduces the main characters, and they will build on the series from that. Overall a great movie, i'm headin' out to see it again right now.",1
114," Giant robots maiming each other, nothing more needs to be said.",1
115," This movie was wonderful. I've been a fan of the series since i was a child and seeing all the characters in vivid cgi was amazing! Whats better is the personality of the franchise has been kept along with some of the sound effects which, like the very design of the transformers themselves, gives them identity. I would have liked to see more European cars (jazz should be a Porsche for example) but the movie is funny, scary, exciting, worrying and one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen.",1
116," I thought maybe this would be a film that was a bad Transformers film but still a good film-film. Sadly I was let down. This is just a bad film. I've been a hardcore TF fan since I was a kid, and to those of you who are like ""I'm not a transformers fan but this film will please both newcomers and hardcore fans alike,"" please -- stop telling me how I should feel about this film. I already know -- I hated it. And where do you get off pretending to know what will please hardcore fans when you are not one yourself? Just stop.",0
117," I was absolutely blown away by this movie. The special effects, storyline, and sound were incredible. This is definitely one of my favorites of all time and I highly recommend seeing this movie.",1
118," Where do I start? The only movie I've ever walked out of, EVER. And I've sat through Bio Dome & Anaconda while scores of people around me walked out. It didn't even matter whether I was a fan of the 80's cartoon (which I was), this was perhaps the worst written movie I've ever seen. Best highlight? When the grunt soldier dials his direct line to the pentagon (apparently all military personnel get a direct phone number to the Pentagon) and a (haha) stereotypical Indian guy answers and starts asking him for his credit card info. Or maybe when the Autobot sends up a blatant ripoff ""Bat Signal"" light into the sky to call down the other Transformers. Or maybe when G.W. Bush on Airforce One asks the stewardess to bring him some Ringdings, she goes down to the kitchen to get some, unwraps it, drops it on the floor by accident, then picks it up & starts eating it (?!?!). What did I learn from this? Well, (1), if you believe your car is stalking you, don't stay inside nice & safe where you already are, be sure to run outside and hop on your mom's bicycle so it can chase you. (2) high school girls run around with the halfnaked body of a Victoria's Secret model, eating exclusively nothing but Burger King & fixing cars, and (3), the (2nd) smartest internet hacker America has is (once again) a hot 'high school' girl who is 6x as smart as any college-trained pentagon official, is granted top-level military access, & figures everything out in an instant. Did I mention that she (thankfully) happens to live next door to the Pentagon, as does her best friend, the U.S's greatest hacker, the (hahaha) stereotypically overweight jolly African American guy? This is far far beyond check your intellect at the door popcorn movie; this is the stupidest commercial for EBay & GM (oops, I meant movie) that I've ever seen. This is the Billy Madison ""everyone in this room is now dumber"" speech in real life. If you fancy yourself to have a brain level above that of a 13 year-old boy, do yourself the biggest favor ever & skip this. If you enjoyed MENSA-level blockbusters such as Resident Evil 2, empty your wallet and come right in and have a seat. Enjoy some 'SHAKEY-CAM"" action! And I though I hated, no, loathed Michael Bay before... if this guy lands another movie, EVER, he & the producer should be thrown in Gitmo. I had a free voucher from the theater for this movie, and I still feel ripped off. I only give it a 1 for the CGI, which was actually no better than anything else the last few years. The only people enjoying themselves we're the two 15 year-old girls behind me giggling at every Shia LeBouf scene, especially the one where the robot rips off his pants (that's right).",0
119," Great photography, amazing special effect. The robots look so real even in the fights scene in the city. This movie is Bad Boy meets with War of the Worlds. Great entertainment, worth going to watch at the movie theater.",1
120,I don't know why critics reviewed this as a 60 out of 100 when this was easily the most entertaining film of 2007 by far. The special effects were amazing and the whole movie was action packed. The transformers looked so real. A lot better than all these shitty movies coming out now such as spider man 3,1
121," OK, so we're not looking at this film as a written masterpiece... rather this was a mind-blowing experience. I still have no clue what the story was about, but my head is still ringing from the sound effects. The sfx in this movie are through the roof! It was so loud that my chair was vibrating for half of the movie. Towards the end I could care less about who was going to win or even how it was going to end. I was going blind from the explosions and deaf from the bass in this movie. And how hot was Megan Fox? I can;t wait to see her in another movie.",1
122," wtf is wrong with you all???? its not perfect but its pretty freakin good!!! it sent chills down my back when they asked the pilot to reveal himself, which he did by disappearing and turning into a deceptacon!!! it may be a little long, sure but it sure as hell isnt boring. great film, highly recommended",1
123," I'm surprised most people adore this garbage. It's just another Bay film. The robots were just silly for 70% of the time and when they weren't silly the human characters were. In fact, the human characters were less believable than the robots. Overall, just an exhausting flick with too many explosions and absolutely no depth.",0
124, I'm sorry but if you grew up watching Transformers like I did when you were younger then this film is absolutely fantastic. This film wasn't made for it's in-depth story and Oscar winning acting. Its all about the Transformers and to be honest they could not have been created any better. Lighten up (or your car may change),1
126," isnt this suppose to be TRANSFORMERS????? well more than half this film was about stuipid teen agers hormons...I mean, who honesty didnt think the two boy and girl couple were not going to get together......The fights were terrible...they looked absoluting beautiful (the transformers, that is) but the huge ending fight was over in like 2 mins TOPS! and it was like a 2 hit fight....like what the hell? isnt Spelberg attached to this film? you know the one who brought us Indania Jones and E.T.......can anyone say that they actually gave to F's for the humans? isnt that Spelbergs big thing? every time i hear him talk about films its always about 'the charaters! I dont care aboutr the effects, I love the charaters' (which should be true) but this film was NO example of that. I guess i can say I felt terrible for the transformer's themselves sense they were being carryed through this disrepectful 'summer time' movie.....However, Not even Micheal Bay can ruin this franchise, but he sure put a baaaaaaad taste in my mouth for whats to come for our robot friends.",0
127," -Opinion: this is what each individual has, so why attack them, insult them, or even threaten to beat people up? -As for my opinion, I didn't enjoy the movie. I went in wanting to really like because 1) the trailers looked great 2) Steven Spielberg was executive producer 3) I've seen some of the older episodes of the show and the old movie. -Let me say that I don't have any bias against Micheal Bay and I don't watch South Park. -I didn't like it because it was just too stupid and silly, breaking away from any main plot-thread which should keep me engaged. It ventured off course too often just to get in a pointless joke. For example, when the squad of soldiers fight Scorpinok, and that one soldier tries to talk directly to the Pentagon only to be met with some tech support guy in India. Totally pointless! Some people laughed, but that just ruins the flow and sincerity of the movie. Was there any conceivable reason to break the action, suspense, and gravity of a life-and-death situation to get one joke in? It's like while penning the script the writers included whatever they thought was funny. Some jokes were way too immature, like the mom asking Spike if he's masturbating in his room (which isn",0
128, None of the original Transformers characters were there,0
129,"Ah, my kind of stupid. You know what, I love dumb movies. As long as I care about the characters, i'll have a great time. Well, this is one of those movies that defines this. This movie is way too friggin cool!! Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg deliver a heart-pounding, explosive blast of a time!! Filled with action, explosions, epic robots, and the hottest girl to walk on the earth, Transformers is an incredibly awesome blast that you have to watch.",1
131,"Posted on 3/20/11 02:35 PMI know a number of you are going to disagree with my rating for this film, but you know what? Screw it, I loved this movie. Yes, Transformers has Shia LeBeouf and Megan Fox acting front and center with a storyline that isn't as interesting as it tries to be, but remind me, whats the title of the film? Transformers. So, who are the true stars of this movie? THE TRANSFORMERS! We didn't watch this movie to see the character developments of Sam Witwicky and Mikaela, we watched it to let our brains off the hook and watch huge CGI autobots fight it out with huge CGI Decepticons, and in that department, the film succeeds, and even surpassess expectations. Huge battles taking place in the desert, on the highway, right in the centre of town, Michael Bay is not afraid to show off the CG-eye candy with (what else?) explosions and big destructions. As for the human side of things, you know Sam and Mikaela are going to get together before long in the film because, well, they're the films leads, but its not too terrible seeing them on their journey to becoming together. Jon Tuturro and Sams parents are funnier than they have any right to be, and Sams mom definately shines in the comedy (or awkwardness, depending on your viewing) when she asks Sam if he's been, ahem, ""partaking in bedroom exercises"" Yeah, we all know this film isn't perfect, one such scene is when Sam manages to outrun Megatron, a decepticon who could simply take a few steps forward and catch up to Sam, but doesnt seem to manage to. Also, quite a bit (okay, a LOT) of the dialogue is bad and cringe-worthy. Also, the film may be Transformers, but quite a bit of the film is centred on Sam and Mikaela, so don't go in expecting wall to wall Optimus and Bumblebee and Starscream. In the same year we got trilogy dissapointments such as Spiderman 3, Shrek the Turd and POTC: At Worlds End, its great to have the Transformers there to pick up our year. Just a shame we got Revenge of the Fallen though...",1
133,"I do enjoy this movie. The action is sleek, and the voice actors are top notch, with great special effects. There are several nodds to the series, which is fun for the older fan. It does suffer from being a big action flick, but this is giant robots fighting, so that is pretty much the territory. The Autobot's shine in the film, and that is just the way I like it. Yes, it isn't the most artistic film out there by a long shot, but it is enjoyable!",1
134,"Great Movie! but the first one rocked . that's it. oh, found a transporter in france :)fun to watch: http://www.lookeen.net/de/352/allgemein/deutsch-e-postbrief-lookeen-stellt-sich-der-herausforderung/",1
135,very good popcorn-action-cinema. For fans of the Transformer-series very satisfying.,1
137,"Sure, Transformers is flawed, with a long length and some laughable scenes, but the action, good directing, a script that works, and overall fun humor and entertainment, Transformers is a slightly above average Blockbusters that makes Transformers work in the Hollywood world.",1
138,"First off i rate movies more by the entertainment value not the fancy specifics that make some film ""GREAT"". Well this movie is my Favorite novie of all time. It has intense action, a very interesting story, Awesome and bad ass characters, and some awesome special effects. The story is simple yet highly entertaining. Two kinds of alien robots (the Autobots and the Decepticons) are searching for a power artifact from cybertron called the All-Spark. While the Autobots plan to use the cube( the All Spark) to rebuild their home the decepticons want to use use the cube for evil. Both groups track the cube to Earth. That is the introduction in less awesome words by Optimus Prime leader of the Autobots. Chaos ensues in the next scene as Major Lennox and his team is introduced during an attack on their base in Quatar by a Decepticon. The next character introduced is Sam Witwicky, a teenager hell bent on selling his great grandfathers trinkets used in an expedition to the arctic circle which plays key to the story so he can buy a car. That car turns out to be the Autobot Bumble Bee. And of course Chaos ensues afer that as well. Thats all ill say on the story. The acting is really good if your interested in that,  but the special effects also help make a real unique experience. By far the best movie ever!!!( or for me at least)",1
139,"Pure escapism, total in-your-face intense action from beginning to end. It is a fantastic movie because it makes you feel like a child with a new toy again.",1
140,"Great Movie!!! Very Action packed. It's wasn't the same Transformers that I grew up on. It's very action packed and if you don't like action movies,then you will not like this one. If you don't know what the transformers were about you may not understand the movie. Go with the flow,good movie,great story line, lots of action.",1
141,"It gets a 1 because I have an irrational soft spot for Bumblebee. Everything else is loud noise, explosions, plot holes and exposition that sometimes involves giant robots.",0
142,"Although i would've prefered the Transformers to look more like their original counterparts(especially Megatron in Robot form & Optimus Prime in Vehicle form),& to have the original megatrons voice to add to Peter Cullens Optimus Prime,this is a massively entertaining movie! In terms of story,humour,characters,special effects & action.Thhis movie is definately up there with my other favorates.I dont get the Micheal Bay hating though.He makes great action movies,end of.",1
143,The superb special effects mask what is a shallow storyline but the movie is still worth watching for anybody that has even a feint interest in action movies.,1
145,Typical Michael Bay movie with great Mech fights,1
147,"This movie really caught me off guard, I wasn't expecting the spectacle that is Transformers. From the moment Optimus Prime and the Autobots entered the picture I was truly enamored. Not only does this movie satisfy the action side of me that likes to see things go BOOM, it also has a healthy blend of humor and a good amount of awesome Sci-FI themes as well. The main human protagonists are fairly enjoyable to watch, but I did feel like they had a bit too much screen time, I mean I did come to see a movie called Transformers right? other than that minor complaint I really enjoyed myself, sure the plot was really simple and character development was at a minimum but the sight of those robot on the screen was just mesmerizing. I had never been so convinced by CGI up until that point. Transformers may not be the most faithful adaption to the 80s cartoon show but there is a certain charm to it that just brings out that nostalgic feeling you had when you played with the toys as a kid. This movie is most certainly worth checking out!",1
148,"Things go boom.  Seriously, who expects Dostoyevsky from a Transformers movie?  Pure mindless, action entertainment, if that's what you're looking for in a shiny high graphics package then hey... this is it.  I enjoyed it for that simple pleasure.",1
149,"When Decepticons arose to power, I really hoped they at least wouldresist good to the ""good guys"", but they just had so many flaws andwere so easily destroyed even by humans, well let's put aside theseinconsistencies with reality, the film main audience are naiveteenagers, only they can't get annoyed by film's apartness fromreality. And also implementing a political undertone in the beginningof the film, it doesn't add courageousness when you just repeat""official stance"" on specific matter, would have been much insightful if it was in contrary to the state's stance or even better don't add such a controversial topic as Iran's nuclear program because it's not the only country to have it and I'm pretty much sure no one ever asks or investigates their motives for doing so and it can be said with no doubt, they wouldn't come up with this for no reason or just because they're evil. So minus for adding political propaganda, even if there's a little of it.",1
150,"It was a good movie. With a cool cast and amazing special effects for 2007 It couldn't be terrible. It was actually a brake from one of Michael Bay's outlandish, boring, and incredibly long empty plotlines with only special effects to its name. But this one carrying out 3 stars and a 61 for metascore it's for sure one of his greater films. Maybe even his best(other than The Rock). It was a uniquely sculpted look at the old and loved T.V. series and action figure fad that I loved so much earlier in my life. I thought it was a fine movie and will be remembered by many in the future.",1
152,"I wasn't particularly impressed with this movie when I watched it for the first time but then it grew on me. Michael Bay has had a bumpy track record, sure, but this movie is remarkable even by every other director's standards. The visuals of course, are simply amazing, the acting is solid and the humor hits the mark. It felt often as though they were trying too hard to make this movie a cash grab, however it's still well done.",1
153,"Since seeing Transformers Dark of the Moon, people have asked me to do a review on the other two films so ill start with the first. definitely one of the best action movies made, the effects are spectacular and breathtaking to look at, and with Peter Cullen back as Optimus Prime (the original voice of Prime) It just makes this action film all the better. Many people I know have complained about how, in the final, I dont know, 45 minutes with the whole city fight, everyone was complaining about how, like, ""I can't tell who's who,"" ""Who am I rooting for."" I hear those complaints all the time about this film, and to me, I really didn't have a problem with it, after sitting through 2 hours of this I was pretty used to what each Autobot and Decepticon looked like. For instance, for the Autobots, i could tell it was prime because, everyone knows he's a Semi, but I also knew it was him from the voice and his colors, or say for the decepticons, I knew it was Starscream because of how he is a jet and has jet wings on his back, or Blackout, because he had helicopter propellers on his back, so I didn't have trouble with it. Another complaint I hear with this movie is that, the human scenes and characters are stupid and nobody watches a Transformers movie to watch the humans, personally I didn't mind them. I thought Shia Laboeuf was good, and Anthony Daniels, they were all great funny characters. All I have really left to say is that, the only problem I have with this movie is the police droid Barricade, You see him clearly in the city fight, but he vanishes after they show him driving into the city, and there are no deleted scenes on the DVD, so I have no clue what happened to him, and he isn't in the second film either, he makes a brief cameo in Dark of the Moon, but then he vanishes again just after his leg is shot off. With Starscream they give an explanation that he flew off into space, they even show that in the credits. But overall this is my 5th favorite movie ever",1
154,"Transformers almost feels like an entirely new genre of film. Surprisingly, these robots in disguise actually have personalities, and you want to care for these characters.",1
155,Great visuals and actions with bullets and missiles flying by. This movie is like a complete military showdown. But there should be more actions where the Autobots fight the Deception.,1
158,"There is one thing that Michael Bay likes to do, and its his overwhelming need of dramatising every single thing in front of you, whether its a few soldiers pacing across an airfield, cue epic music, a few people climbing out of a car, cue epic music, this happens over and over again in Transformers, the loud, big-budgeted sci-fi film that is fun, silly and full of massive robots that can only be admired, but the film also brings an over-bearing human element that can way the film down. Bay certainly has an eye for the spectacular and epic, with Transformers being no different, we open with a brief introduction from a booming robotic voice telling us about the war between the Autobots and Decepticons, an ancient alien race from the planet Cybertron who bring their battle to earth in search of the AllSpark, a powerful cube holding vast amounts of energy capable of massive amounts of power and of course, destruction.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is the unlucky human caught in the midst of this war, as his grandfather made the discovery of these robots many years before, Sam now hold a pivotal piece to the puzzle which is needed by the Transformers. But this young teen has his own troubles, something we are seemingly forced to care about, a teen drama involving Sam getting the girl, in this case, a beautiful girl called Michaela (Megan Fox), who doesn't have to do very much onscreen except move her body to certain angles so as she can be filmed in certain ways, its wasteful but I suppose necessary, because every film needs the good looking girl, right? This drama along with an over-arching military thread of a story certainly leaves very little room for the Transformers, who become a side note, even though the film is almost 150 mins long. But in terms of spectacle, it doesn't get much bigger than this, the way these robots transforms from vehicle to natural form looks amazing as these aliens tear each other apart in the air and on the ground, special effects don't get much better than these, as the realism of these machines unmatched.There are certainly many things to like about 'Transformers', we have spectacular set-pieces and some heavy lifting robots there to entertain us, but these robots also feel very underused, while the human element starts off light-hearted but becomes serious which in turn is just ludicrous. Even though there is comic relief to be found in John Turturro as a dedicated agent and a small role for the late great Bernie Mac, Transformers has an unlikeable and far too talkative lead in Shia LaBeouf's Sam Witwicky, more focus should definitely been put on the aliens.",1
160,"I hadn't seen this movie in a while and I forgot just how much I enjoyed it. I thought the action sequences were incredible and if nothing else, these make the movie worth watching. However, I also thought the cast was great. Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Rachael Taylor, and many others make up a deep and talented supporting cast and while Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox both take a lot of heat for various reasons, I thought both of them were fantastic in this film. I also enjoyed how the plots developed. You have varying aspects of the entire story developing separately and with different styles but they merge in the end seamlessly. There were also plenty of funny moments that get some laughs. Most of them of by way of comedic relief characters in the decepticons but a lot of the dialogue was also humorous. Overall, this movie is definitely one of my favorite comic/superhero movies.",1
162,"Now here is a decent action movie. It's not great, but it's definitely not bad. It's kind of what you would expect from Michael Bay, nothing more, nothing less. It doesn't have a great cast, but who cares? Go rent it and have fun!",1
163,"This film was nearly unbearable. The special effects are well done, albeit excessive. I thought the action sequences were lackluster (and those were the main event). Unsurprisingly, I found myself yearning for something greater by the end, but I became cynical about the sequels.",0
164,"This is a giant mess of a movie. Even the action sequences are unable to redeem it. From the very first shot, you will be left in a state of confusion that is never resolved. The plot is all over the place and the piss poor editing is nauseous.",0
166,Perhaps the best special effects I've ever seen in a movie. The transformations are amazing not to mention super-awesome. The CGI fits in seamlessly with the live action and it's easy to forget how logistically difficult a lot of it would have been to film.,1
167,"Good action, a pretty good story, hot girls, and giant transforming machines are what Transformers offers, and delivers superbly.  I had the pleasure of seeing this for the first time in a drive-in theatre on a mild summer night.  Everybody, and I mean everybody, had their vehicles open and the sound pouring out, and it made for an excellent experience.",1
168,Michael Bay has finally made a good film. The story was rock solid with visuals that were excellent. Even though I don't care for Megan Fox as an actress she didn't do a horrible job. I think everyone would enjoy this film.,1
171,"""Transformers"" is an entertaining explosive summer movie directed by Michael Bay. Like all Bay movies, the script is pretty weak but the action is exhilarating. However, ""Transformers"" has a pretty good plot combined with excellent CGI, making this Bay movie a recommended summer blockbuster.",1
173,"Well with Age of Extinction right around the corner I figured there was no better time to look at the movie that started it all. The plot is actually better than you'd expect in a giant robots fighting movie, with the Autobots trying to find the Allspark before the Decepticons who all have really cool names (my profile is named after Starscream so I guess I'm kind of biased) The acting's not bad either all though it's funny to watch now since we all know what became of Shia LaBouef. But of course the action's all that matters and while I feel that this is the weakest of the trilogy in terms of action, watching two robots fight it out in the middle of a crowded city never gets old. However by far the most important aspect of this movie is that it introduced a generation of new fans to one of the greatest sci-fi sagas ever told, which is certainly something to be proud of.",1
176,"I don't know why people hate this film because there is no ""philosophical messages""; just light and noise. And? The TV series were just like this. Michael Bay just did what he had to do: resurrect Transformers, with spectacular visual effects and amazing action. I'm Spanish, so I say... Viva Transformers y un aplauso para Michael Bay.",1
179,"I never really expect this movie to be anything, since I never imagined that a live action version would work at all. BUT, I hate to say it, Michael Bay didn't do a bad job with this movie (I feel so dirty right now!) This movie acts as a great introduction to the transformers and does a decent job making them believable and reintroducing them to this generation while still showing respect to its fans (not as much as they could have, but enough.) Overall: A fun movie that did its job and reawakened my love of the Transformers franchise.",1
180,"This is not a good movie at all. The story is extremely dull and it's pretty much about big explosions and special effects, but I'm sure you already knew that. I'm also pretty sure that the characters were intentionally designed for you to hate all of them by the writers. So to summarize this awful movie in short, terrible story and characters. Absolutely nothing but special effects.",0
182,"The only good movie in the series.  Unlike it's sequels the action is very impressive, instead of annoying, the humor works, instead of giving headaches, and the scenes with human characters are actually passable.  The story needs some work, and it can at times be kind of stupid, but it's nowhere near the shear mental handicappedness of its sequels screenplays.  It's not anywhere near perfect, but it shows that the franchise had potential and could be entertaining at one point.  Why did revenge of the fallen have to be such a huge disappointment?  Did they even try to make a decent sequel?  I don't think so.",1
183,"Transformers is a great Science- Fiction/ Action movie because it kept me entertained the entire time and it never lost my interest once. Plus the acting, special effects, action scenes, dialogue, humor, and the awesome climax all combined make one heck of an action movie. P.S., Even though it's 144 minutes long, it doesn't matter because you will be on the edge of your seat the whole time.",1
184,this movie is surprisingly good  i don't normally like movies with massive technology and massive production but this movie took me by surprise  with it's great story  original idea  great performance by Shia LaBeouf and i loved the transformations in this movie and the comedy was actually pretty good.,1
185,"This movie has got really good effects. Also it doesn't gets you bored. There is some funny part, some dramatic parts. This movie is full of action. If you want to watch a movie which do you want to impress you then you should watch this movie.",1
186,"I think out of all of Michael Bay's movies this one was surprisingly his best. This was a fun action-packed thrill ride. Bay does tend to (at times) throws in some stupid humorous scenes that distracts the story. Like the scene when Sam's parents barge into his room. That scene was completely unrelevant. Plus Sam's ""mom"" is just so freakin weird. But thank God he doesn't do as much as his other films. Overall, this was an enjoyable action thriller that re-defines Hasbro's classic.",1
188,"A solid start to a shaky trilogy, the action was mind-blowing and the acting wasn't bad either. The last battle between Optimus and Megatron topped off a strong movie",1
190,"I don't like long multiple plug for products in movie it is shameful Bay needs to learn commercials are for tv not movies. Cliche after cliche is annoying nerd gets hot girl,government incompetent until the end etc. Micheal 'the butcher' Bay does it again. But is was entertainment non the less.",0

196,"Transformers is visually stunning and has thrilling action sequences, but offers very little depth, extremely poor character development, and is mostly brainless.",1
197,"What's this? Michael Bay actually making a good film? 'Tis true, ""Transformers"" is actually a pretty good film. Sure, it's characters aren't amazing, and it's a little too long, but ""Transformers"" is one of the few movies that actually ends up being a great time, even if it's only great for its visuals and action. But man, the action scenes are fantastic. It's not cinematic brilliance, but Michael Bay has crafted a nice film in ""Transformers"" and it's definitely worth one watch.",1
198,"The film that destroyed almost every shred of faith I ever had in ""blockbuster"" movies. How Michael Bay can make a fight between two giant CGI robots one of the most boring things I've ever witnessed, I will never know...and for this reason, I'm forced to categorise this as an ""art film"" ('cause Lord knows, I certainly didn't ""understand"" it)!",0
199,"Good start to the franchise, could have been better had Bay focused on the Transformers and less on the underdeveloped human characters. Its a good technical achievementm the special effects still hold up well when Bay assaults your eyes and brains with his usual ""Bay-isms""",1

206,"Technically speaking fellows and ..girls My REAL rating for this movie is a 8.5/10. I just rounded this number and it goes to a 9 , to be fair. Too bad metacritic doesn't allow you to give a rating like a ""8.5"" DUE TO THE FACT THERE IS A DECIMAL. But anyway, now that you know my real score, Transformers, is one of the BEST CGI FLICKS I HAVE EVER SEEN. And many reviews hold this line. Looks like Michael Bay has spitted out his inner self with this film, lots of behemoth bots smashing things up and the robots are just plain cool looking when transforming into earth's everyday machines. I am so glad I got this movie on Blu-Ray ( got the blu-ray player on black friday (2014). Hopefully, I'll see the movie in 3D or 4K one day. Transformers is a definite fun summer blockbuster movie and something new and fresh to see on the screen. Transformers have transformed people into fans and this will satisfy in the amazing CGI action route for pratically EVERYONE.",1
207,"After watching Transformers, I must pay homage to director Michael Bay for sharing his recreational interests with the rest of the world. Until this moment, I knew little about his fierce fervour towards the field of alchemy. But now I perceive him as a perfectionist. He has somehow turned human excrement into film.Transformers is a 2 and 1/2 hour long video game that the audience isn't allowed to play. On the IMDB trivia page it says 'The most amazing thing about Transformers is that they set the release date without a completed script'. I beg to differ. The most amazing thing about Transformers is that they finished filming without a completed script. Transformers is contrived, convoluted and incoherent on so many levels that most would call it unworthy of serious examination. Transformers isn't only critic-proof, it resists serious criticism. You might as well analyse a beach ball. The immoderate overload of CGI, ugly set-pieces and mind numbing action made it impossible for me to shut my eyes and dream of a better movie. It's not merely bad; it's unpleasant in a hostile way. Apparently Michael Bay was inspired by David Cronenberg's 1996 film Crash. And now that I think about it, I can see the mild resemblance. Both movies are like watching automobile accidents. Only one was intended to be. Add it all up, and what you've got here is a waste of good electricity. I'm not talking about the electricity between the actors. I'm talking about the current to the projector.",0
208,Transformers (2007) is an awsome movie. The CGI effects are so great that they look real. The action is amazing. The transformers are great. I recement this movie to people who loves giant robots and much action (There are small action scenes in the first half and a big battle in the end).,1
212,"I guess this one's good.  Entertaining in a very Michael Bay-ish way, but still fairly solid in its own right.  The action was good, the effects were great, and the humor wasn't all too bad either.",1

214,"Tra tutti i film live action basati su una serie animata,su un fumetto oppure su dei super eroi in particolare,Transformers rimarrà per me uno dei migliori mai creati,una saga che inizia bene e continua ancora meglio,infatti il quarto capitolo è per ora il migliore della quadrilogia,a mio parere.",1

216,"Yes, this is one of my most favourite films! Even though i'm not really a fan of G1 Transformers. I love this film so much! The only problem is that it has less action than it's sequels",1
217,Transformers is a movie filled with solid characters and fantastic CGI and fight scenes. The running time could've been shortened but overall a great movie. Peter Cullen did an amazing job at voicing Optimus Prime as well! 8/10 (great),1
219,"Although, essentially, far from the quality of the original anime series, Bay's first installment of his commercially successful yet critically hammered money-magnet series was quite good. It offered a new perspective on animation and it certainly elevated the technique. The plot was actually quite good, lacking any major holes or inconsistencies and you could certainly enjoy the full length of the movie without actually wanting it to stop. The actions scenes, so characteristic for Bay and his work, actually had a measure and the movie gave you just the right dose of such scenes not to bore you or laugh you to death. The Transformers were crafted in a very interesting way, adding dynamics to the somewhat too robotic interpretation we've seen in the animated series. The only thing you couldn't actually ignore were Megan Fox and Shia LaBeouf. Megan is a really, really bad actress... I don't have anything else to add. Shia has, in some of his more recent roles, shown a certain amount of skill, but his role in the Transformers series wasn't all that good. You just couldn't get past the irritating teenager act and he never actually tried to elevate that, despite certain possibilities. On the other hand, Turturro was a definite scene-stealer, but even Bay can't eliminate the quality of John Turturro. All in all, the first Transformers film was a well-realized project that actually gave us high hopes which were, sadly, annulled throughout the years. Something worth watching, certainly, even for those who aren't Transformers fans, but still, note that you shouldn't expect more than a better-than-average action movie with giant robots transforming into all kinds off stuff.",1
220,"You can't go into this movie expecting THAT much, but for action it delivered the goods like no other movie in 2008. Sure, Bay has no shame, and he uses every cliche in the book, but it's still a fun ride, and Shia LeBeouf adds some weight to the mayhem. If nothing else, rent it for Megan Fox, man...seriously...",1
221,"Of all the films that Michael Bay has directed, this and 'The Rock' (1996) are some of his cleanest ones. However, I think that if 'The Rock' didn't exist, this film would be a 9 or even a 10. But it gets an average 7 and here's why. 'Transformers' follows the story of a young, high school boy named Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) who gets caught in an incident when a group of autobots want his grandfather's glasses that contain some secret piece of information. The lead autobot is Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) who wants Sam's help to retrieve theses glasses and keep it away from the evil Decepiticons. Sam has a car that is also a transformer who is called ""Bumblebee"", and can only communicate with Sam via radio stations. Megan Fox plays Mikaela, Sam's love interest, who sticks around because the screenplay says so. While convincing acting can be tough to come from Fox, these two actors do have very good chemistry together and they seem convincing as a couple. Why she sticks around during all this robot rumble though can be a little hard to believe. The film's biggest weakness however, is the comedy. We've seen elements of comedy in past action movies, but they were always subtle and the director's of those films didn't rely on funny one-liners or ironic incidents to keep their movies at an entertaining pace. Another weakness is the run-time, while 'Transformers' isn't the most difficult movie to sit through with all the robot destruction and explosive action, the run time can make it feel like you're sitting through an extended edition of 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' (2003). The film goes on for half an hour too long, and you know it's a problem when you stop caring for the characters after having seen what they've gone through in the first two hours. Michael Bay is a very ambitious director, famous for not being so respected with film critics and typical movie-goers, but here, he has demonstrated that maybe he can direct an action film, a ""Transformers"" film at that. I never grew up with the Hasbro Transformers toys as a child, I was more of a Lego kid. Maybe my opinion on this film may not count, but, you either judge this as a film based on toys, or you judge it as an action film in general...I think action fans will get what they deserve, but overall, there has been better.",1
222,"This movie might espouse some jarring Michael Bay oversexualisation and explosions, but there is no doubt that this film is a great, and the only good Bayformers film. Endearing nods to the cartoon, epic soundtrack by Steve Jablonsky, interesting story, good acting, amazing action and CGI, and a perfect amount of human-Transformer interaction. Bay hit it out of the park. I just wish the other 4 films had been made with love and care like this one.",1
223,"61? 6.9? Are you serious? I will say again, as I've said in previous reviews I can't stand that this site has credibility when it rates something like Transformers, the original movie that spawned the most brilliant CGI and action that we've seen in our lifetime, a 6.5/10. Not to mention the huge budget it provided for the next, whatever, 8 they've made since then, that probably have higher ratings on this site. But I guess I'm here to try to swing the pendulum. Michael Bay forged the future of movies and action movies but nobody wants to give the movie the credit it deserves. Not to mention, this franchise is the 11th highest grossing of all-time. By fact, and by way of cause-effect, that couldn't have happened without a good starting movie.",1
224,"Сценарий слаб, но эффекты спустя 10 лет до сих пор смотрятся потрясающе. Всё таки - это лучший фильм в серии, чем дальше, тем хуже. Итог: Поклонникам боевиков рекомендую к просмотру.",1
226,"This movie is pretty amazing. By far, one of the best of Michael Bay's career. Its a pretty good adaptation that stayed true to the cartoon. Had good acting, groundbreaking CGI, plenty of entertaining action. This is one of the movies that the military would very much be involved and they are incorporated into this movie well. Of course, this movie had some Michael Bay-isms and some of them worked well in the movie like the explosions. But of course, we had the others that were unneeded but still, very easy to overlook because of how great the rest of the film was. Loved it when I first saw it and I still love it now.",1
227,Transformers is a fun action popcorn flick with plenty of entertainment value and likable characters and survives the poor script and stereotypical humour,1
228,"When it comes to Transformers, I have no ax to grind, pro or con. For me, it's just another loud, plot-deficient summer motion picture. In this case, nostalgia doesn't grip me - I'm too old to have played with the gadgets or watched the cartoon. I'm sure many fanboys (and girls) will be delighted by what Michael Bay has done to update the Transformers mythos (basically, that means incorporating A-level special effects and blowing lots of things up). On the other hand, those with no particular emotional attachment to the toys and their multimedia offshoots may dislike this movie as much as I did. Thus far, the summer of 2007 has been full of very loud, very unsatisfying action movies. Transformers tops them all - it's louder, flashier, and more hollow than anything else out there. At 135 minutes, it drags - sometimes painfully so. The movie is top-heavy with exposition, and the only decent action scenes occur in the final 25 minutes. Despite an epileptic camera, those sequences are impressive from a special effects point-of-view, but they aren't exciting. That's because the characters are so poorly developed and the Transformers so singularly uninteresting that the question of who wins or loses doesn't matter. All the effort behind Transformers went into making the robots look cool; nothing went into developing a compelling storyline. Even the headline bout between Optimus Prime and Megatron is pedestrian - two big metallic monsters slugging it out while the camera spins around them as if out of control. It's kind of reminiscent of the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots going at it. If the dialogue is anything to go by, Bay has a sense of humor. Not only does he take a moment to poke fun at one of his earlier hit movies, but he allows so many howlingly bad lines to be spoken that the level of self-parody has to be intentional. Transformers is a jumble of the good, the bad, and the ugly, with the latter two categories outweighing the former. The film has a lot of nice touches (such as the opening attack in Qatar, where there is a sense of danger, and the John Hughes-inspired introduction of Sam), but the meat of the story is plodding, recycled sci-fi drivel. That, I suppose, is what happens when a major motion picture is based on a 20-plus year old toy phenomenon. Transformers is so belabored that it makes Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End seem like a masterpiece of pacing. It makes that ""classic"" midsummer alien invasion movie, Independence Day, seem like a template for inventive plotting and solid character development. Even by Michael Bay standards, this movie is vapid. Yes, there are plenty of explosions, but those are a dime-a-dozen these days; even Discovery Channel's Mythbusters has them. Transformers isn't clean, big-budget fun; it's clean, big-budget tedium. For Transformers fans, I suppose this is a dream motion picture. For everyone else, it's a nightmare.",0
229,"Transformers is a full action packed, funny and thrilling movie but in some aspects like the story and screenplay are pretty messy. But in general is a BADASS MOVIE.",1
230,This is the best movie ever it has lot of action and its just very very great. Transformers are all epic and thei battle is really great made. Sequels arent as good as this one but they are good too.,1
231,"Transformers is not the smartest movie out there, but it is a ton of fun. Michael Bay managed to create a mediocre adaptation of the Transformers animated series and probably his best film to date. It does have poor character development and acting performances, but the action sequences were so intriguing, that we almost forget the fact that they have these flaws. We expected a spine-chilling, robot-rumbling film and thats what we got. Rating: 7/10 A+ = 10A = 9A- = 8B+ = 7B = 6B- = 5C+ = 4C = 3C- = 2.5D+ = 2D = 1.5D- = 1F = 0",1

235,"Transformers is a perfectly functional blockbuster. It's shot and acted well, and has some thrilling action bolstered by incredible visual effects. It's light and fluffy entertainment done mostly right. There's not much beneath the surface, and some needless toilet humor pops up here and there, but all things considered, it's a mostly good time if you're looking to waste a few hours.",1
236,Action packed sci-fi movie with some dad/mom jokes thrown in to keep it light now and again.,1
237,"It's usual Michael Bay stuff - close-ups of hot chicks, top-notch special effects, and slow motion in front of american flags or helicopters with dusk or dawn in the background. The action is fun to watch and that's all you really need to know.",1
238,"Pros: -Really good action scenes.-The actors are doing a pretty solid job.-The human characters, while a bit generic, are likable enough.-Decent score.Cons:-The human characters, while likable enough, are still kinda generic. I honestly wasn’t expecting them to be super deep since this is Michael Bay, who is notorious for making style over substance films, but that still doesn’t excuse it. -Not all of the attempts at humor land.-Certain things in the ending, such as the Allspark killing Megatron and Bumblebee getting his voice back out of nowhere, could have been explained better.Final verdict: Transformers 1 is a pretty decent sci-fi action thriller that is easily still the second best Transformers movie (based on what I have heard, I have not seen any of the other Transformers movies aside from Bumblebee) and I would say that if you are interested it is worth checking out. However if you want a REALLY good Transformers movie, I’d still say go watch Bumblebee before this.",1

From terrible characters to dialogue sounding like a 12-year-old write, this movie doesn't and will never hold up for the years to come.  I hate this movie and the entire series as a whole and it was painful to watch this entire series be around as long as it was under Michael Bay.",0

Some people are complaining about charactar development in this film, but unlike the other bay movies, at least it has.

The boy was exciting at that time and suddenly, he began to feel good because he knew that the robot is good and help to save the world. After that, they collaborated together to overcome the evil and tried to find those box. They were trying to escape every obstacle and saved the people's life from the bad things. Finally, they found the rare box and help the world to live with peace. Sometimes this story is hard to follow because it’s a kind of Sci-fi action movie. Some scenes I understand, but some scenes not. One thing I felt happy with this movie is, it’s predictable because I knew much about the action movies which are always happy at the end. Obviously, I love this movie because of its realistic, technology, and scientific. I will spend my time to watch another part of the movies very soon!!!",1
