Even the first 30 minutes is pretty cheesey in nature as well-predictable and a story that has already been told. But the story turns to a more family oriented,family saving ordeal with feeling in that the viewer can identify with the predictament the family begins to face. If you begin to watch this, give the slow moving tale some time",1
1,This was a very sweet and thoughtful film highlighting how momentary decisions can completely alter your life's path. I enjoyed the humor and wide range of emotions the story explored. This is one of my top ten favorite movies. I highly recommend watching it on a breezy summer night with a nice glass of wine and people you enjoy.,1
2,"Whoever gave this review less than 11/10, is a complete idiot because this is one of the best movies ever created. I laughed, I cried (a lot) and I'm a male....and straight...I only created this account on Metacritic to rate this movie...will also probably rate others. While I'm here, Inception and Butterfly effect were awesome",1
3,"Albeit not being incredible, it's a good-intentions film for happy minds and people who don't want to be too involved when watching a film. It's true, everyone would wish to have Tim's gift, and the flaws in the time travel rules explained throughout the film didn't actually bother me at all. It's not a film about time travel at all, it's just a romantic comedy where a man has the chance to do things over and over till they're the way he wants them. Stupefied by the fact that Rachel McAdams would take on a role in ""Time Traveller's Wife"" and then in ""About Time"", but whatever works for her. Bill Nighy is spectacular as always. Gleeson is not much but he's supposed to be the average man so that kind of fits. Rom-com with no dentist required, it's okay. And Uncle Desmond's character is brilliant.",1
4,"In regards to the film “About Time”... In this age of out-of-this-world ridiculous visual effects, computer graphics, action stunts and massive Hollywood blockbuster productions worth hundreds of millions of dollars, we get this subtle little film “About Time”, which offers us the complete opposite of what we, as an audience, have come to expect from Hollywood to entertain us. The film is exquisitely scripted, backed by tremendous performances by the actors, especially by Bill Nighy, and most of all, the film gives us a dose of deep, meaningful emotional roller coaster.At the beginning, we find that the central character’s family has a deep secret: the men of that family are able to travel back in time. This makes one skeptical of the entire movie: haven’t we already had a story like this before? From this point on, it seems as though the plot and the dialogue of the rest of the film are like a subtle closing argument as to why that time travel aspect is not really an important aspect of the film, although it does affect the story.Another misconception of this film is that while it seems like a story of a man and a woman falling in love, it really is about the relationship between a father and a son. Their storyline pretty much outclasses and overshadows every other storyline of the film. From that prior skepticism when we first hear about the time travelling ability, as the story unfolds and the plot thickens, the audience becomes emotionally manhandled. Why? Because of love.We see the chase for love, the choices that are made for and because of love, the consequences of love, and finally, the hardest part for us humans when we deal with love: knowing when to let go and have the courage to move on after losing love. That skepticism that I mentioned about at the beginning of the film? It dramatically changes into support, with the audience longing for the son to use his abilities more and more. You can sense, hear and feel the emotional wreckage going on in the theater, not because of the romance between a husband and wife, but because, for most of us, we don’t have that loving relationship depicted here between father and son.This movie couldn’t have come to Korea at a better time. With Christmas almost here, it’s almost as though this film has come to remind us that with the time we have, maybe we need to focus on what is really important to us. Even in a materialistic society like Korea, maybe this movie can remind us and help us move in the right direction little by little.",1
5,"I have a feeling that ""About Time"" will become a beloved movie in my family, from now on. Authentic, positive, real, warm, and filled with wonderful characters and messages. I loved this movie. It is not so much a film about a time traveling man as it is about life and relationships in every form.",1
6,"About Time is a sweet movie, lives to its joyous script and direction. It's a film that doesn't waste your time but does make it. Have a second chance in life, so have it. The acting was great and Bill Nighy doesn't dissapoint but makes it better. Watch it, and love it. One of the best comedies of this year yet.",1
7,"In short, About Time is a movie about time, and not wasting any of it. It introduces us to a young man named Tim, who is told an unbelievable secret from by his father. The secret, we find out, is one of both consequence and great possibility. About Time is a coming of age tale that will make you laugh, cry, and ultimately appreciate the little things, and the little things inside those little things that make life amazing. Thanks, INeedToPee",1
8,"10/10 after watching thousands of moves, I think I might dare say this, I might watch it again... Just for the sake of it, ok now i'm just exending this to",1
9,"About time, for me was a great film with laughs and lows throughout. The main actor in the film was brilliant at potraying the role really well, also everyone did a great job. They really did a good of making time travel nescassery but they didn't advertise making you realise how great life really is. What really shocked me is how emotional this film is, the ending made everyone in the cinema sob in tears, really. So overall a great time.",1
10,"""About Time"" is a film all about being able to go back and have a second chance... That being said, I would still see this film.  Lots of unanswered questions, and I didn't feel there was any climactic scene, but the movie made me think. It's a good film, and I'd recommend it.",1
11,"Just so everyone knows, my last username was ""man"", but the account was deleted. So this is my new username. But anyway, I was very satisfied with how well this movie turned out. The chemistry between Domnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams was a pure delight to watch onscreen! The rest of the supporting cast, including old school English actor Bill Nighy also did superb! It's the characters in this movie that really bring out the emotions I felt while watching this. They really make you feel something! The story felt a little ""Been there, done that"" at times. However, it couldn't defeat the true charm and joy this movie made me feel! So overall, this movie really was an absolutely delightful and charming experience! For me, it was quite possibly this year's best romantic comedy as well!",1
12,"A socially awkward guy learns that he has the ability to travel through time, so he does what most of us would do in that circumstance So about time is a feel good romantic comedy about tim this social outcast who never stood out in life bill nighy who plays his father comes to him and tells him that all the males on their family can travel trough time what does he wants not money or fame or glory he just wants him to get a girlfriend which is simple read full review  http://cinews.info/in-cinema/About-Time.php",1
13,"About time is about a boy who can time travel. Extraordinary, don't you think, but not as extraordinary as having a father who lectures at university and owns a 3 million pound mansion, or young women working in publishing who can afford to rent city centre London apartments, or as extraordinary as an England that looks beautiful and benign in every single frame, or a struggling playwright of crap melodramas who lives in a £2 million town house. Richard Curtis has Out-Richard Curtised himself here. Absolutely appalling film full of simpering little twerps and the usual quota of quirky friends we are suppose to think are charming. Will appeal to moron American's with their chocolate box ideas of olde England and its charmingly awkward chaps. Couldn't crowbar in a disabled person to signal your right on cred this time Rich? Or perhaps you did? I only watched the first 20 minutes before doing a bit of time travel myself and hitting the fast, fast, fast forward button.",0
14,"About Time is a charming, utterly tender tale of life, love and the extraordinary of the ordinary. Much like the narrative of the film, Tim travels to the past and back to the present to perfect all the imperfections of his life, yet the film is anything but perfect, and that’s ok. Suffering from inconsistent plot-points to breaking the rules that the film outlines, About Time is surely not a tightly-constricted narrative leap for the genre by any means. Regardless, the film casts an enchanting spell that not only lifts one’s spirit, but causes you to merely forget about the rules Curtis makes, and breaks. Writer/director Richard Curtis has had quite a bit of luck in the romantic-comedy genre, making major waves penning Bridget Jones’s Diary, Love Actually, Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral. Although he has stated that About Time will be his final directorial venture, only behind the aforementioned Love Actually and Pirate Radio, Curtis has succeeded well beyond many of the directors and screenwriters who hoped to successfully recreate anything Nicholas Sparks‘ has made, with the exception of The Notebook, of course. Fresh, spontaneous and demanding emotions, Curtis has brought new light to the British romantic-comedy front and has made the kind of films one isn’t ashamed to laugh and cry at. Once Tim finally meets Mary (Rachael McAdams), Tim knows he has found the reason to adequately use his time-traveling powers. At first glance, Gleeson and McAdams seem like a poor physical match for a film that at times could be distracting or awkward. Instead, much to the extent and reality in life, the two feed off one another’s unique characteristics splendidly. Tall, pale and with a hint of orange hair, Gleeson‘s unqiue on-screen charm is brashly alluring. McAdams on the other hand, stripped of all glam and instead substituted with a rather rag/tag girl-next door look, reminds us why she is cast in these roles and how easy it is to fall in love with her  quirks and all. McAdams, who is no stranger to the time-traveling love story narrative, venturing in her third quest as the desired love interest, first inThe Time Traveler’s Wife and two years later in Woody Allen’s acclaimed Midnight In Paris, enchants and reminds us just how adorable and likable she really is in these roles. Bringing a believable essence to the role of Mary, McAdams just may cement herself in time as the go-to, romantic-comedy poster girl. As a love story, About Time succeeds. As a tale of morality, a lesson on making each day your last and as a film about the bond between father and son, the film triumphs. Gleeson and Nighy share some of the most sentimental and heart-wrenching moments of the film that are sure to get your eyeballs sweating with joy. Incandescent as father and son, the two actors shine as the heart and soul of the film. As the pendulum swings closer to the end of the year, About Time will surely be atop my list of guilty cinematic pleasures of 2013, especially since I am such a sucker for hopeless romantic love stories with an underlining patriarchal theme. About Time may be a highly decorated cautionary tale of the beautiful moments in everyone’s seemingly mundane life and the short time we have to live it, but the film, whether romantically tied or generationally suggestive, is a movie about appreciating the little things. “Some days you want to re-live forever. Some days you want to live once”, and Richard Curtis and company really hammer that notion home with their newest film. Essentially, About Time is really all ABOUT LOVE, and we are alright with that.",1
15,"This movie sucked.  It was slow, dull, sappy, overly sentimental...I was so bored.  I understand it was a romantic drama, and maybe that's just not my cup of tea, but I thought it needed more light hearted laughs to keep my interest.  Not much happened, and it was mainly a real downer.  I did like the actors, so that's one good thing, but I felt like this movie was a waste of money overall.  I should have watched something else.",0
16,"Just awful. I enjoyed the Time Traveler's Wife, and this was like that except lacking everything that made that movie interesting, with hardly any significant, interesting time travel and a boring, pathetic loser for a main character who never grows at all throughout the movie. The film doesn't make you care at all about ANY of the characters, in fact, because it never really tries to. The only ""tear jerking"" that happens is because of the sappy music and the marriage and baby stuff that some women love to fawn over despite the lack of connection to any of the characters in the film. It drags on especially toward the end for no real apparent reason other than to add to the sap appeal for the characters that we have no connection whatsoever to because, again, none was ever developed. The reviews promised a chick flick that men could actually enjoy. It did not deliver whatsoever. I can't see anyone with taste enjoying this film. Rated 2 because the first 20 minutes were somewhat interesting. The only people who could enjoy this film past the 20 minute mark are, to put it bluntly, airhead girls and eunuchs.",0
17,this a story of a guy who for some reason can not find a girlfriend while living in London. To get one this poor sod has to resort to time travel  Sounds like it can be a funny movie except for it tries to be a drama and completely fails at that as no one in the right mind can take this story seriously nor is there any emotional attachment to any of the main characters.,0
19,"It turns out that the movie is not about a love story. It’s more about fatherhood. It’s a shame it had to sell the love story part in its promotion to get people watching this movie. The directing and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful. In terms of directing, this is a wonderful swan song for Richard Curtis’ directing career. However, the story lacked strong conflict. The love story in this movie did not have any conflict at all. It seemed like it’s too much of a perfect romantic story, which felt unrealistic. And the plot holes in this story is very noticeable. To get my point, I had to list down the time traveling rules, applied in the movie. 1-)Only male members of the family can travel in time.: This rule was broken when Tim traveled way back in time from the beginning of the movie with his sister, Kit Kat. The question why Kit Kat was allowed to time travel as long as she is with her brother is not answered.2-)Only travel to the past is possible: This rule was broken when Tim arrives in the past and then goes back to the present time. The question why Tim cannot go to the future, but can go back to the present is not answered.3-)It is impossible to go back in time before you were born: The first rule that wasn’t broken.4-)Traveling back to a time before your child is born will cause a different child to be born and the original child will be lost: And the last rule that wasn’t broken either. With these plot holes and the story lacking conflict makes the movie a bit boring to watch. The humor, however, saved the movie. It was funny and smartly written. While this time traveling romantic-comedy movie is not memorable, its humor, charm and beautiful setting will remain you to watch the movie until the credits roll.",1
21,"Very bad made movie.  Old tricks, awful actings, long and boring ""going-back-to-the-past"" over and over again, not reflecting the truth of a real life (at least doesn't convince me).  Totally a waste of my time.  And it's definitely the worst movie I've seen in 2013.",0
22,"Watched this movie last night and can't believe the poor reviews I'm finding on here!  While it did start off a little slow, it was extremely well crafted with a brilliant storyline.  I actually couldn't stop crying even after the movie was over!  It was a sweet love story (can't imagine any movie with Rachel McAdams not being just that!) and also included a very special bond between father and son.  I'm shocked so many people didn't like this movie!! I absolutely loved it!!",1
23,The time traveling is not explained well. The father and son appear to never have disagreed about anything ever.  There is maybe 20 mins of conflict in this 2 hour film.  It is essentially about a Hugh Grant knockoff playing puppet master with other people's lives and we are suppose to accept this as a good thing--that others might prefer how the events played out initially. Of course he doesn't tell his wife anything.  Rachel McAdams plays a woman whose sole purpose in the film is to adore the male lead and have her life manipulated unknowingly by him under the illusion that he always make the right decisions for the both of them.  There are also montages. Lots and lots and lots of montages.,0
25,"Man, what a nice lil film. did you like ""the time travelers wife""? did you like ""the butterfly effect""? how about mixing the 2 together, adding Bill Nighy and Rachel Mcadams to the cast, and you get a lovely film. granted, the first 30 mins are a little ""long"" but you'll like it in the long run!",1
27,About Time is a curious look at time-travel and the ability to fine-tune moments of one's past. Curtis challenges us to become emotional invested and succeeds. Rachel McAdams is as magical as ever.,1
28,"Light movie, enjoyable flic, where nothing bad happens. Good watch with ye' girlfriend or aunt. Time travel adds a nice twist, tough not very consistend plot.",1
29,"I am typically a major hardass. Plotholes bother me a good bit and good writing is a major concern. Sure, About Time's time travel makes no sense to the point that it openly contradicts itself repeatedly. It certainly does that. However, forget all of that About Time is a charmer. It is so adorable, moving, and emotional, I would truly have to be soulless not to be swept up in its beautiful portrayal of life and its perfect imperfections. This film is truly a delight in every definition of the word. Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams have incredible chemistry and are so adorable it truly caused me physical pain. The film made me laugh, cry, and smile, all at the same time for its depictions of love and of loss, especially given the situation of the film. It may be super sentimental and is certainly guilty of squeezing every last tear out of you purposely, but dammit if I would not love to cry while watching this one again. Endlessly watchable and overflowing with unadulterated charm, About Time redefines delightful cinema and makes me willingly blind to its own flaws, just as I should be in life.",1
30,"The great subtlety of the film is what makes it great. We do not need anything more than the characters, we dont want to know anything except for where they go, how they will act or react, that's where we run into the biggest hit of About Time, you care about these people.",1
31,A film you fall in love with even knowing their are some small time travel issues.  The acting is top notch the music is great and the film left me really adoring it.  A-,1
32,"I am confused, one side i am thinking that how you can so oversimplify the time travel and it's relevance and on the other side i find the basic theme of the movie very beautiful. It's freshness is the biggest attraction as well as the biggest drawback. But still it's a beautiful drama if we just ignore our normal mindset towards time travel.",1
34,"In the format of a chick-flick, ""About Time"" should not be mistaken for one. Intimate and heart warming, yet a surefire tear jerker, the film gives us an original storyline and a beautiful (as always) Rachel McAdams. A feel-good movie for the ladies AND their dates.",1
35,"Flawed but fascinating, About Time is emotional, heartfelt and sentimental at the same time and manages to balance a good plot which fortunately never feels like a rom-com as the previews would suggest.",1
36,"i did not see the ending which was a bummer .  i wish i can travel in time to fix my mistakes  but i  can't. i love rachel mcadams and i love this film .  i am in 6th grade and i want my future to be perfect and have a good child and have a good wife  thats why i am so nervous about  the future you never know if your gonna have a good future or not . thats why i love this film here's why  its about  love , time , romance , and a good life .",1
37,"I watch a great many movies, and am usually disappointed, bored or frantic about the amount of money that was spent in order to make such drivel.  And then along comes pure entertainment, wrapped in a neat little packaged called ABOUT TIME.  If I don't nod off during the first quarter of the film - if I am totally engaged - laughing out loud all by myself -- weeping a few tears of joy at perfect moments in the film -- then I will be happy and feel that it was money well spent.  I rarely urge others to see a film because we all have different tastes.  My taste is:  if I am entertained, made to feel good, and if I watch the credits rise up on the screen with a feeling of having been totally whisked away to a better world -- then I am happy.  Forget American Hustle,  forget Django Unchained;  come away with a good taste in your mouth for once and watch ABOUT TIME.  Well done!",1
38,"My husband and I enjoyed this movie very much. It was charming, sweet, funny  and clever.  Loved the characters.  How refreshing to watch a movie that doesn't leave you in the doldrums.   We liked it so much we invited our friends to watch it with us again.  They loved it, too.  I would like to see more movies like this produced.  We are tired of the violence, ugliness, and darkness of most movies produced today.",1
39,"I will introduce you about a movie which name is “About Time.“ The movie is a romantic comedy of Domhnal Gleeson who is famous for Harry Potter series and Rachel McAdams who is famous for Sherlock Holmes series. A main character who is a boy lives in a small town has a terrific magic. The magic is a skill of time traveling. After his father told him they have a skill of it, the boy always travels time whenever he wants. The boy wants to meet a true love. Then one day, he met an attractive girl at a bar. They fall in each other in first sight. They loved truly and got married. The whole story is about like this. I feel really cozy while watching the movie. The movie gave me a kind of tip to find a good partner. Before I watch the movie, I thought the only thing important of my lifetime companion is apperance. However, I　realized that the more important than appearance is inner side beauty. In these sense, “About Time“ is didactic movie for people who fine their lover.",1
40,"What an ending.... so weird. How on earth they made the ending so flat? It feels like being left alone in the middle of the tour or this traveling thing. It's sweet, full of cute chats, and natural laughs. The movie nailed to make me falls in love with the man character. But, the ending, was easily to forget. So, the whole movie made me remember all of them, but when people asked me of the ending, I bet I'll answer, ""What ending?"" They shouldn't end it. I refuse the ending of this movie.",1
41,"About Time is a well crafted feel good movie. When the movie ends you will be smiling from ear to ear. I was very interested in Tim's trek through life with the ability to travel in time, but it is also not perfect. He still had to deal with hardships over his life. Its the perfect mix of romance comedy and drama. I really enjoyed Bill Nighy in the role of the father in the movie.",1
42,"Flawed but fascinating, About Time is emotional, heartfelt and sentimental at the same time and manages to balance a good plot which fortunately never feels like a rom-com as the previews would suggest.",1
43,"I realized after about half an hour that I was watching a romcom disguised as a time travel movie.  Charming idea, everyone is lovely, but in the end without darkness I get bored pretty quick.  Everything feels so chirpy in this movie.   I'm giving it a 3 because it's possible for me to imagine many people liking this movie, but I did not.  I stopped after about an hour of not really caring what happens next. The lead character is completely unrelatable.  His love affair is completely unbelievable. I don't even care if at the end something cool happened and I missed it.",0
44,"Absolutely extraordinary!Great act by all the players and most of all stunning direction and writing by Richard Curtis.The film is quite slowly but it's more than fit it, I recommend highly watching this film alone while imagining yourself as the main actor.",1
46,"""About Time"" 10 Scale Rating: 7.5 (Very Good) ... The Good: Very well done and well acted, ""About Time"" is touching, funny, and sentimental without being sappy. Domhnall Gleeson was excellent in a lead role and Bill Nighty was amazing (as usual) as his father. The characters are fleshed out and you easily grow attached to them. One of the more surprising films of 2013. The Bad: What prevents the film from being truly great is the inconsistencies found in the story. Early on you are given very clear cut rules for time travel, but more than halfway through the film those rules are inexplicably tossed aside. I can overlook something like that to an extent, but in this case it is so blatant and frequent that I just can't ... especially after they went to such lengths to make the rules clear to us.",1
47,"This was a warm movie that reminded me of the importance of family. Just like the other working title's movies, it was ambient and calm, which made me fluttered. The music contributes to making this movie beautiful. Even now when I think of its music, I can't stop smiling. I sometimes watch this one when I feel like it.",1
48,"This movie is not only focused on romance. The movie is related to Tim's love, family, and friends overall. Even though he realizes he could return his time back and utilizes it well at first, he begins to let time flows by itself. The movie wants to tell you that what's really important is seeking time travel method and use it in genius way, but manage your own given time well and enjoy your present.",1
49,"About Time is a very unique film about time travel, it is a very interesting and delightful film that makes you think about life itself and just how much you should enjoy life day to day, it's has an amazing soundtrack and just an amazing love story, it's like The Notebook with time travel.",1
50,"The film deals with a thing that we have all wanted to use some moment in life, time travel fix a mistake, do something that should have done before the protagonist is a family of men who has this wonderful power and the film shows how he deals With him during the plot, for this detail we often have the sencation of everything he did and conquered during his life after knowing his powers was not fair, but somehow we also have the cencation that he deserves everything, especially his wife Who has a very great chemistry with him, the two do want everything right, the movie has great secondary characters with their own characteristics among them what I liked the most was the father of the two has a very strong relationship of father and son and This is more evident in the final part of the third act of the film, one of the only bad points is that most of the time you know when and how he will use the time travel to fix his mistakes,Emotive, funny and fun note 86",1
52,"I love this film. I hadn't heard of it and took a chance on it on a British Airways seatback screen. Since then I have bought it and show it to everyone I can. So far they all love it to (and say ""why have I not heard of this movie?"") The low ratings by critics are very disappointing. All I can imagine is that they must be judging that it doesn't fit perfectly into the film structure they were taught in film school, and even more importantly, they distrust movies that make them feel. The film is a bit like ""Groundhog Day"" in a number of ways, but ""About Time"" much more deeply involved in relationships where ""Groundhog Day"" is completely centered around one character who only manages a relationship at the end.",1
53,"It is just as simple as it gets, not much to look at. But the dialogue, the performances and the story sell me all the way through.",1
54,"""About Time"" may not have the best of scripts (there are mistakes there that could have been avoided), but it has a good plot and knows how to make the public excited and thoughtful. Domnhall Gleeson was still on the rise at the time and grew a lot from that movie. Rachel McAdams delivers a cute performance, while Bill Nighy shines as the zealous and gentle father of the male protagonist. Even the then rookie Margot Robbie delivers a precise performance, although the character appears little and does not require much development. The soundtrack is flawless.",1
